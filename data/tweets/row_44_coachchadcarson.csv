Buy 20 rentals during a 5 to 10 year growth phase.\n*Focus on houses & small multifamily, and work to buy at discounted prices or with value-add potential to quickly increase equity.\n\n2.

Make more money\n3. Pay more taxes\n\nIt's not a ""benefit"" to make LESS money just to save on taxes.\n\nThis is business 101.\n\nBut there's more to the story:\n\nReal estate has many tax benefits, like depreciation ""expense"" that shelters income from taxes.\n\nWhen you pay off a mortgage, you don't lose this benefit!\n\nThe depreciation expense is still there.\n\nIt shelters the same amount of income from tax as before you paid off the debt.\n\nYou simply have more income! \n\nBut you might argue that you'd GROW more buying more properties, not paying off 5% debt.\n\nThis is true. But it's not the same as tax benefits.\n\nLeveraged returns on more properties will probably be much higher than 5%.\n\nAnd you'll also have MULTIPLE properties which produce a lot MORE depreciation.\n\nThis extra depreciation shelters more income from tax - compounding wealth even more.\n\nThis is probably what people mean (indirectly) with the advice not to pay off debt & lose the tax benefits.\n\nBut instead of a ""tax benefit"" question, paying off debt is really a GROWTH vs RISK question.\n\nBuying more properties with more debt is riskier.\n\nAs a new or growing investor, the risk is probably worth the reward.\n\nBut once you've built a lot of wealth, the risk calculus changes.\n\nWhy risk everything you've built just to get a few more properties & more ""tax benefits""?\n\nPaying off 5% debt at this later stage could be a good option.\n\nIt's in the same low-risk category as buying a treasury bond.\n\nAnd it produces instant cash flow because you no longer have a mortgage payment.\n\nPlus, paying off debt is SIMPLER and frees up more TIME than owning more rentals.\n\nThe more wealth you build, every extra dollar become less valuable than extra MINUTES and a WORRY FREE mind.\n\nAfter all, isn't that the type of freedom that motivated us to invest in the first place?!","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",18,0,4,0,2,4337,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1664281073629671428"

"1701330218433036469","2023-09-12 04:21:47 +08:00","In 2014 I began a journey to build a network of walking and biking paths in my hometown area of Clemson, SC.\n\nI was frustrated that it was unsafe to walk a 1/2-mile to the local park with my 3-year-old daughter. And I LOVED other communities and countries where it was easy to walk and bike. \n\nLittle did I know how hard this journey would be! \n\nBut as an entrepreneur, I began asking ""how can we fix this?!""\n\nSo, I started learning and reading books like Walkable City Rules by @JeffSpeckFAICP & @StrongTowns by @clmarohn\n\nI talked to our @CityofClemson planning department.\n\nI participated in community long-range planning meetings. \n\nI met with @ClemsonUniv professors.\n\nIt turns out I wasn't the only one who cared about this!\n\nAnd one architecture professor - Dan Harding -  had been working on an idea with students called ""The Green Crescent Trail."" \n\nThe vision was to build a walking and biking path to connect:\n- Clemson University's core campus \n- The City of Clemson's downtown\n- And the amazing 17,500 Clemson Experimental Forest encircling the community. \n\nBut as with many good ideas, it didn't have traction OFF the university campus.\n\nSo, a group of local volunteers and I formed a non-profit in 2015 called the Friends of the Green Crescent (@GreenCrescenTr).\n\nWe held meetings.\nWe raised money. \nWe built public awareness.\nWe organized people.\n\nOur first big win was a $25k grant from Pickens County to conduct a 2016 feasibility study in two communities - Clemson and Central. \n\nThis gave us a map, cost estimates, and a less-fuzzy big picture vision of the trail system.\n\nBut the hardest part would prove to be implementing the vision.\n\nWe didn't have 22 miles of ""rails-to-trails"" (@railstotrails ) like Greenville, SC with the Swamp Rabbit Trail.\n\nSo, to piece together a potential trail network we relied on voluntary easements through or along:\n- private property\n- city parks\n- sewer easements\n- churches\n- and existing roads\n\nAnd we had a hard time figuring out where to start with over 30+ miles of potential trails. \n\nSo, we spun our wheels for several years with little to show for it. \n\nBut eventually our persistence and public communication paid off.\n\nCity Council members started running on agendas that included the Green Crescent Trail. Funding followed.\n\nLeaders at local colleges/universities began publicly supporting the trail effort, including:\n-  Clemson University (@ClemsonUniv)\n- Southern Wesleyan University (@SWU_edu)\n- Tri-County Technical College (@tctcedu)\n\nAnd very importantly, our new SC state representative Jerry Carter (@CarterSCHouse3) championed our cause and secured $1 million from the state to help us build the trail.\n\nWe also received private donations, a $50,000 sponsorship of one trail section from local hospital @AnMed_Health, and federal and state grants.\n\nAround $4 million has been raised to date! \n\nThis has been enough to finally build some real trails.\n\nLater in 2023, a segment of over 3 miles connecting the City of Clemson and Clemson University will open. \n\nIt will connect to important public spaces like:\n- the SC Botanical Garden (@SCBotGarden), \n- Clemson University's campus\n- City Parks\n- Clemson Elementary School\n- Many neighborhoods in the core of town\n\nA few other segments are funded and in various stages of design and engineering in Central and Clemson. And we're working to connect to other nearby towns like Pendleton and Seneca. \n\nMy 3-year old daughter is now 12 years old! And it's still not that safe to walk or bike all around town. \n\nBut I've found a lifelong passion project in improving community walkability and bikability.  \n\nAnd I've learned that you can make a difference in your community if you:\n- have a strong vision\n- get involved locally\n- and team up with amazing people\n\nI don't have it all figured out, but I've invested THOUSANDS of hours trying! \n\nSo, I'm happy to discuss and answer any questions for others interested in this.","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",63,4,2,0,9,12652,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1701330218433036469"

"1703196273984037356","2023-09-17 07:56:50 +08:00","I've roughly had three phases during my journey as a real estate investor.\n\nPhase 1 - Beginner:\nAs a beginner in my early 20s, the game was to learn, make progress, and build relationships.\n\nIn those days, I flipped houses to make a living, and my wife worked as a Spanish teacher.\n\nWe used Dave Ramsey's envelope system to watch our spending. And I used low-money down strategies and house hacked my way into rental properties.\n\nPhase 2 - Wealth Builder:\nAs a wealth builder in my 20's and 30s, the game was to GROW a small amount of wealth into a large amount of wealth.\n\nI got really good at finding deals. And I mainly grew with value-add houses and small multifamily.\n\nI scaled using private money loans, seller financing, and other creative financing strategies.\n\nPhase 3 - Harvester:\nThen things changed for me about 9 years into the journey.\n\nI had enough wealth (millions of $) to THEORETICALLY live off of.\n\nBut it wasn't optimized.\n\nI wasn't generating enough cash flow as a % of my wealth.\n\nI had some dead weight properties that were maintenance nightmares and money pits.\n\nAnd I had a lot of leverage and risk.\n\nSo, the new game was to harvest the wealth by:\n- Turning equity into cash flow\n- Pruning bad properties\n- Derisking the portfolio\n\nThe primary tools were:\n- Strategic refinances\n- Selling certain properties\n- Paying off debt\n- Growing equity, but not always adding more properties (#smallandmightyinvestor)\n\nI also did a whole lot of work on systems and team building (outsourcing).\n\nMy business partner and I self-managed properties with an internal property manager for a while. And when she retired, we outsourced to 3rd party property managers.\n\nThe Harvester Life\nThe work is never over, but after 5-6 years of work on harvesting wealth, the result was:\n- More cash flow\n- A less risky portfolio (<20% debt-to-value)\n- And less time required to manage the portfolio (about 2 hours per week).\n\nIn my personal life, this coincided with taking longer sabbaticals with my family - in 2017 living 17 months in Ecuador and in 2022 living 12 months in Spain.\n\nI also still worked, mostly writing, teaching, and volunteering with a non-profit I co-founded to build walking & biking trails in my community.\n\nMy wealth didn't grow quite as much as it could have during this final phase of selling, deleveraging, and taking time off from maximum earnings.\n\nBut in the new game, the goal was to optimize LIFE, not just returns.\n\nAnd the only metric that matters to me now is how I spend my TIME.","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",23,2,3,0,1,5344,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1703196273984037356"

And he didn't want to deal with them. \n\nSo, I agreed to buy the property for $200,000, pay $20,000 down, and take on those problems myself. \n\nThe real sweetener for me was $180,000 of seller financing at 4% interest, fixed for 25 years with a payment of $900/mo.\n\nDon't Pay Off the 4% Mortgage!\nAbout 6 years after buying the property, it was stabilized and performing well with a long-term tenant.\n\nBut I'm not as comfortable with retail commercial. I prefer residential. \n\nSo, I decided to sell it.\n\nBut I DID like the seller financing mortgage with fixed payments and 4% interest for another 19 years.\n\nSo, I decided not to pay it off.\n\nOne Profitable Little Clause\nIn the seller financing contract, I had negotiated a clause called a ""substitution of security""\n\nIt said ""Borrower may, at Borrower’s option, substitute the security for this Note to another piece (or pieces) of real property.""\n\nSo, before I sold, I showed the former owner a 4-plex rental that I owned. It was worth $375,000.\n\nHe agreed to RECOLLATERALIZE  the seller financing note with a mortgage on this 4-plex. \n\nThe Transaction Details\nDuring the sale of the commercial property, the closing attorney satisfied the original seller financing mortgage at the county recording office. \n\nBut the attorney did NOT pay off the seller financing note/debt.\n\nInstead, the attorney just created a NEW mortgage for my seller and recorded it in first position against the 4-plex. \n\nThe $156,000 I still owed the seller was now secured by a mortgage on this 4-plex  property. And I kept making him payments of $900/month like always.\n\nPaying Off Higher Interest Debt\nBefore this transaction, the 4-plex had a $145,000 mortgage that I owed to a private lender at 6% interest.\n\nI used the proceeds from the sale of the commercial property to pay that lender his money.\n\nThat allowed me to secure the $156,000 seller financing mortgage in first position mortgage. \n\nThis was effectively a refinance of my 4-plex. \n\nBut I sourced this refinance money from another deal by thinking ahead when negotiating seller financing. \n\nToday's Mantra: Borrow Low, Rent High\nThe key strategy in a rising interest rate market is to figure out ways to lower your financing costs.\n\nMy example can be replicated. \n\nYou could buy properties with seller financing - likely on properties that have problems, that you may not even want to keep long-run.\n\nYou could negotiate attractive interest rates between 0% to 5%, fixed for long-terms, with a substitution of security clause.\n\nThen you could sell the property and use the sales proceeds to pay off high interest debt or even cash-out equity on your long-term keeper properties. \n\nThink of it as ""flip-for-financing."" The financing you keep could be as valuable as the profits you make selling the original property!\n\nAnyone else doing this or plan to do this?","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",88,11,59,4,15,15116,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1714717781302649016"

Without a team, even a great property could be a bust.\n\nThird, there are simpler ways to diversify, if that's my goal. \n\nThere is an ongoing ""mental drain"" of paying attention to specific properties in many locations - especially international.\n\nFourth, I don't like to mix-up fun and investing. \n\nEmotionally, it might be satisfying to own something in a place I love. I could visit it repeatedly. \n\nBut I'd rather follow @financialsamura 's mantra to ""own utility and rent luxury. ""\n\nIn other words, use the rent from boring properties I own in a place I understand to PAY FOR the rent and other fun, luxury experiences living in another country. \n\nThat'll likely continue to be my strategy going forward, but I'd love to learn from others who have invested in Spain or other countries internationally.","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",5,0,1,0,2,1320,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1716523753721544888"

"1719160906377011202","2023-10-31 09:14:35 +08:00","Last week I analyzed several different investment property deals with fellow investors during 1-1 coaching calls.\n\nIn every case, the deal didn't appear to be good at first.\n\nBut the gold of good real estate deals is often found by digging below the surface.\n\nIn one case, an investor got rejected after making a seller financing offer.\n\nI recommended that he follow-up with an offer using a 5-year lease with an option to buy at the full asking price. \n\nIf successful, the seller would get their price and avoid management headaches.\n\nAnd the investor would benefit by controlling the property's potential appreciation with little risk. \n\nHe'd also make cash flow today  and avoid having to use bank financing at 8%+ interest rates.\n\nAnother investor was evaluating a subject-to-the mortgage deal.\n\nTheir hunch was that the numbers - as presented from a wholesaler who brought the deal - didn't work.\n\nOur analysis confirmed their hunch.\n\nBut we evaluated what numbers WOULD work by adjusting the price down. The investor can now go back and confidently make this lower offer to the wholesaler.\n\nOf course, the wholesaler will likely say no. But there's always a chance of a yes. \n\nAnd even if this deal doesn't work, the investor now has increased confidence on what price and terms WILL work as they continue to make offers.\n\nYet another investor was finding that most small multifamily deals she evaluated didn't make sense as an investment.\n\nSo, we isolated the reasons why they weren't working, and then we discussed the ""levers"" she could possibly change to make future deals work.\n\nThese levers included:\n- Offering at a lower price\n- Asking sellers/builders to buy down mortgage rates\n- Negotiating seller financing\n- Paying larger down payments\n- Paying all cash for a property (using her own cash or a partner)\n- Negotiating a subject-to-the-mortgage purchase\n- Finding higher rent exit strategies (like short or mid-term rentals)\n\nBy understanding these potential levers, the investor will now adjust her buy box and search for properties with a higher likelihood of success.\n\nIn all these cases, staying at the surface-level analysis would mean NO DEAL.\n\nBut by digging into the mechanics of financing, seller negotiations, and pricing, the glittering gold of real deals starts to shine through.\n\nThat doesn't mean every deal will work. \n\nAnd you'll still have to work hard to find good deals.\n\nBut who said it was supposed to be easy?!\n\nNot me!\n\nI'm just saying that good deals are possible today.\n\nAnd at least for me and the people I'm working with, that's exciting, hopeful, and gives us a reasonable investing plan moving forward.\n\nWhat's working for you with real estate deal-making?","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",14,3,1,0,1,3053,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1719160906377011202"

Franklin started the FIRE movement (financial independence retire early) 275 years ago!\n\nHere's how he did it:\n- Learned useful skills (printing, store clerk)\n- Started a business (printing) using funds from partners\n- Networked and got involved in his community of Philadelphia\n- Built a reputation for hard work, quality, and reliability\n- Remained frugal and saved money\n- Expanded his business vertically into newspapers, book publishing, and postmaster\n- Expanded his business geographically into franchises and partnerships in other regions\n- Reinvested much of his profits into real estate\n- Set-up a partnership with his foreman to take over the business and pay Franklin half the business profits for 18 years\n\nWhen he retired from his media conglomerate, Franklin’s share of the business profits were £650/yr or over $170,000/year in 2023 dollars.\n\nBut what did “retire early” really mean to Franklin?\n\nLike today’s FIRE movement, the idea wasn’t to sit around doing nothing.\n\nHe used his abundance of time to:\n- Read books\n- Study interesting topics\n- Make scientific experiments (remember the kite and lightning?)\n- Volunteer for civic projects\n- Get involved in politics\n- Travel the world\n- Meet interesting people\n\nI respect Franklin’s mid-life professional pivot.\n\nHe could have grown his business, tried to “10x” his money, and been like today’s “I want to be a billionaire” trend.\n\nBut instead, he channeled his ambition, curiosity, and entrepreneurial skills beyond endlessly chasing money.\n\nThe result was Franklin:\n- Made breakthrough scientific discoveries in electricity, meteorology, oceanography, and demography\n- Invented the lightning rod and bifocals\n- Started the first successful lending library and volunteer fire department\n- Founded the University of Pennsylvania\n- Helped to write the Declaration of Independence\n- Gained pivotal support from France as a diplomate in the Revolutionary War\n- Negotiated the Treaty of Paris to end the Revolutionary War with Britain\n- Donated money and time as a philanthropist to fund initiatives like the first public hospital\n\nAnd of course, his face is now on the $100 bill, aka a Benjamin!","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/0yqxhWrBuP"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F94qnG8WQAA0DSd?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F94qnG8WQAA0DSd?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",37,4,9,1,8,6889,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1719858992304787468"

"1721558222622917090","2023-11-07 00:00:39 +08:00","I bought 22 properties with seller financing in my first 13 years of real estate investing\n\nAnd today with 7-8% interest rates, it's more valuable than ever because you can often negotiate better rate & terms than institutional mortgages\n\nBut seller financing work a little differently than normal financing, as you can see in these diagrams.\n\nWith normal financing, a third party loans money to the buyer. \n\nThey actually give you, the borrower, money.\n\nWith seller financing, the owner of the property agrees to wait for part of the purchase price over time (aka an installment sale). \n\nThe seller essentially gives you CREDIT, not money. \n\nAnd that's the key difference.\n\nThe psychology of a seller, especially if they're a little motivated, is much different than a lender.\n\nThe lender is afraid to lose their money. So, they screen and underwrite you heavily as a borrower.\n\nThe ideal seller financing prospect has a problem property and likely a management headache. \n\nIf you're trustworthy and can solve their problems, they may sell you the property and become ""your bank."" \n\nAnd the seller's worst case - getting the property back - just gets them back where they started. \n\nA lender's worst case of taking back a property is usually a problem. It's what caused the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \n\nThat's why I find it easier to convince someone to seller finance their equity than to loan me the same amount of money. \n\nOf course, not every seller will finance a property. \n\nThat's why investors should have an entire toolbox of different financing strategies. \n\nBut if you're not out making seller financing offers today, you're missing out on a big opportunity.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/Aqd2XcjZw8"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-QxLBZXsAA0uz1?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-QxLBZXsAA0uz1?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/Aqd2XcjZw8"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-QxPVMWYAA5SPs?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F-QxPVMWYAA5SPs?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",33,2,23,0,5,7032,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1721558222622917090"

I sold it to my tenant with seller financing:\n- $128k = Price\n- $28k = Down Payment\n- $100k = Seller financing at 8.232% interest\n\nBut didn't I forget something?\n\nI still owed money on my original seller financing! \n\nThe balance was $103,500. \n\nBut I negotiated something important: no due on sale clause.\n\nThis allowed me to sell on owner financing in second position, but keep the underlying financing in place in first position.\n\nSo each month a third party escrow agent would:\n- receive $969/mo from my tenant-buyer\n- pay out $650/mo to my original seller\n\nI got to keep the $319/mo difference\n\nThat would have been nice, but we actually decided to do something different ...\n\nI SOLD my $100,000, 8.232% mortgage to an investor friend for $90,000  cash (a $10,000 discount).\n\nHe liked investing in mortgage notes for cash flow, and he was comfortable with the downside of a $90k note secured against a property that worth $128k.\n\nBut he didn't want the underlying, original seller financing mortgage on the property.\n\nSo, my original seller agreed to take a slight discount ($3,500) for a payoff of $100k.\n\nWhere'd I get the cash to pay it off?\n\n$90k from new investor\n$28k from tenant-buyer\n=$118k of cash\n-$100k payoff to original sellers\n-$3k of repairs/closing costs\n=$15k net cash to me\n\nThis was my first seller financing deal at 25 years old.\n\nLooking back it was a lot of moving parts for $15k + a few years of rental cash flow\n\nBut it taught me many techniques that made me a lot of money since then, including:\n\n- Buying with seller financing\n- Lease options to tenants\n- Seller financing to tenants\n- Selling mortgage notes to private investors\n- Negotiating NO due on sale clauses\n- Wrap around financing \n\nWhen you learn to control the financing, you learn to control real estate deals and make more money\n\nAnd the cool thing is those lessons are especially relevant TODAY","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",29,2,11,0,4,6330,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1721933604312224233"

"1735310725696848009","2023-12-14 22:48:12 +08:00","A Secret Business Lesson I Learned From Ebenezer Scrooge 🎄\n\nThis fall, my daughters auditioned to be in a play at a local community theater. To my surprise - my older daughter got a primary role!\n\nShe’s the ghost of Christmas past in A Christmas Carol, the classic story by Charles Dickens. My younger daughter is an extra, but she still enthusiastically strolls in the background in her Victorian-era dress! 😊\n\nI thought I already knew the entire story, but I was surprised to pick up a secret business lesson from Ebenezer Scrooge, the lead character...\n\nThe Cold, Greedy, Old Scoundrel\nScrooge is, as Dickens describes him, “… a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!”\n\nIn short, he’s a cold, selfish, and greedy business person.\n\nBecause of this, four ghosts visit Scrooge one Christmas Eve to show him the error of his ways. And he has a personal transformation as a result.\n\nScrooge wakes up on Christmas a joyful, caring, and compassionate person. From that point forward, he shares love and generosity with the people around him.\n\nScrooge's dramatic change is a wonderful part of the story, no doubt.\n\nBut have you ever wondered how Scrooge became such a miserly, cold person in the first place?\n\nBefore Scrooge Was a Scrooge\nI learned the back story of Scrooge from my daughter, the ghost of Christmas past.\n\nIn one scene, she travels back in time with Scrooge to his younger days as a 20-something apprentice. His mentor is an older business man named Mr. Fezziwig.\n\nIt's Christmas Eve, and Mr. Fezziwig insists that they put their work down, dance, and have fun at a party with his family.\n\nAt the party, Scrooge dances, laughs, and even falls in love with a beautiful young woman. He later asks this young woman to marry him.\n\nSoon after he falls in love, Scrooge tells a friend, “One day I will make my fortune so that I will deserve her!”\n\nAnd that’s what he set out to do.\n\nScrooge Sprints Up the Wealth Building Mountain\nWith his goal in mind, Scrooge dedicates himself passionately to working long hours and saving money. His combination of ambition and skill make him very successful at this aim.\n\nBut eventually, his fiancé breaks off their marriage engagement.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Scrooge’s passion for work and money become an obsession. He forgets the very reason he dedicated himself to work in the first place!\n\nSaid another way, Scrooge falls in love with the FUTURE, which is a fantasy.\n\nAnd he forgets the PRESENT - where the person he loves actually exists.\n\nAs a result, his fiancé tearfully releases him from their engagement.\n\nRegret - The Greatest Tragedy of All\nYoung Scrooge gives up love for money. For me, it was the saddest scene of the entire story.\n\nThe old Scrooge - reliving the scene next to the ghost of Christmas past (my daughter!) - just sobs to himself with regret.\n\nNow he knows how he became the old, miserly, pitiful Scrooge.\n\nScrooge's Transformation is OUR Transformation\nThankfully, we learn from Scrooge.\n\nBuilding wealth is wonderful. We should all work at it.\n\nBut the point isn’t the money itself.\n\nWho cares if we’re a billionaire and have the most money possible (the topic of today’s podcast below).\n\nThe point is to live your best life!\n\nThe point is to do what matters!\n\nIf we keep THAT goal in mind, we can live life without regret in both the present AND the future.\n\nIt was his choice.\n\nAnd it’s a choice we all face as wealth builders.\n\nThen and now - Scrooge is THE example of the dark side of financial ambition left unchecked.","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",6,0,0,0,1,1041,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1735310725696848009"

"1754225770136752157","2024-02-05 03:29:50 +08:00","This post by @moseskagan  brilliantly explains the systemic issue of our undersupply of US housing. \n \nLocal government policy (zoning, parking mandates, rent control, etc) interfers with the mechanism that would normally balance out the supply-demand gap. \n\nMy hometown and state of Clemson, South Carolina don't have the rent control issues of west coast. \n\nBut the ""not in my backyard"" sentiment is deeply entrenched. Largely politically  conservative voters ironicly want MORE gov't control of local housing policy, not less. \n\nTheir suggested solutions are restrictive zoning (ex: over half the town is large lot single family zoned) and requiring most new devopments to be planned developments where approval is basically decided after months or years of public hearings. \n\nThe natural consequence is sprawl outward into neighboring towns, which strains transportation infrastructure. \n\nSo, I don't see how housing ever becomes more affordable. \n\nThere are too many existing property owners (aka voters) who benefit from limiting supply because their housing prices go up and they get to freeze their neighborhoods from changing. \n\nMore supply would keep existing prices down and supposedly change the ""character"" of the community. \n\nThat's bad for these existing voters who yell at and influence local city council decison makers. \n\nNew supply is only good for non-voters (future buyers or renters) who can't get their foot in the housing market door. \n\nLocal decision makers don't hear from them or take their needs into account.","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","1753129954303263220",15,1,1,0,2,2915,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1754225770136752157"

Same as decks \n\nWood Solutions:\n- Buy or remodel rentals with low-maintenance exteriors (brick, stone, cement board and/or metal)\n- Consider selling rentals with too much exterior wood\n- Keep wood decks smaller\n- Use non-wood materials for windows, decking, and railings when possible. \n\nWater Problems: \n- Excess moisture in crawl space or basement (causes mold/fungus and rots wood structure)\n- Plumbing leaks (same)\n- Excess moisture inside house (same)\n- Flooding (self-explanatory) \n\nWater Solutions:\n- Buy ""high lots"" that sit above the grade of the road so that water naturally runs away from property. (Yes, you can install French drains, dehumidifiers, & sump pumps but they require regular upkeep & can fail)\n- Install quality gutter systems that divert water away from foundation\n- Avoid complex roof structures prone to leaks (my favorite rental property shape is a simple rectangle!) \n- Install thick plastic vapor barriers in crawl space\n- Seal foundations with water impermeable membranes\n- Proactively replace old plumbing with pex + high-quality joints and fittings (over time)\n- Remind tenants to run heat/air units in summer even when gone (necessary in humid south where I invest)\n- Don't buy in flood plains (duh!)\n\nWhat'd I miss?","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",22,2,12,0,3,2868,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1759219329755980256"

They liked investing with each other, so they did repeat business.\n\nFind lazy (but experienced) money:\nTo keep a small group of investors, John focused on more experienced investors with more money to do more deals.\n\nThey liked real estate but wanted a more passive investment (which John could provide). \n\nTRUST is a competitive advantage\nHaving a trusting relationship with investors who have plenty of money meant John never had to worry about finding money for deals. \n\nAs a result, John has consistently bought properties in many different economies and markets, even early on when he didn't have as much cash. \n\nLong-term partners ONLY:\nJohn finds partners who have a long-term, buy-and-hold mindset like him. \n\nHe recommends avoiding get-rich-quick types or people who have to borrow their cash.\n\nSet reasonable investment goals:\nWith money partnerships, don't make promises of certain returns. \n\nInstead, make a simple goal - like holding until a property doubles in value. \n\nThen revaluate options such as:\n     A. both partners sell\n     B. both partners keep holding\n     C. one partner buys the other out\n\nUse simple structures that also align incentives\nJohn uses a few basic structures with money partners and lenders:\n\n(Structure 1) Own together as ""tenants in common"" (a type of legal ownership). \n\nThe money partner invests the upfront cash and/or credit. And John provides the deal and management. \n\nThe money partner deeds John 50% interest in the property and loans John his 50% of the partnership funds at 0% interest w/ no payments.\n\nAfter that, everything is split 50:50 (profits and expenses)\n\n(Structure 2) Use a lease option. \n\nPartner owns property. \n\nJohn manages using a master lease and has option to buy 50% of property at some point in the future (which would then  turn into structure 1). \n\n(Structure 3) Private loan from money partner.\n\nInstead of a partnership, use a partner-lender relationship.\n\nPay simple interest to lender. \n\nDon't forget about tax benefits!:\nUsing simple but flexible partnership structures like these also allows you to create profitable tax strategies\n\nFor example, by owning as tenants in common - one partner can sell and use a 1031 exchange while the other can cash-out and just pay taxes. \n\nAnd by using a lease option for some partnerships, you can sell OTHER properties you own, use a 1031 exchange, and already have a property identified to buy instead of finding new ones. \n\nKeep it SIMPLE:\nIn general, keep your deals, your business, and your life as SIMPLE as possible!\n\nFor John, this means owning single family rentals in quality locations with tenants who stay for years.\n\nJohn understands these deals. \nSo do his money partners. \nAnd they all benefit in the end.\n\nRely More on Trust Than Contracts\nTrust and alignment of interest - not fancy paperwork - make partner deals work. \n\nYes, still put things in writing, but contracts aren't solutions to problems. \n\nThe only ""teeth"" is litigation which makes lawyers rich (not either partner).","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/WJdKse5pRK"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLOG44_XsAA2p6M?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLOG44_XsAA2p6M?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",16,1,10,0,3,1369,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1779918834939441437"

"1787670648396935370","2024-05-07 10:27:50 +08:00","You can roughly divide the world of residential rental investments into two groups:\n\n1. Growth\n2. Cash Flow\n\nGrowth investments have lower rental yields (i.e. net rent / price ratios).\n\nCash flow investments have higher rental yields.\n\nBut which is better?\n\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger wrestled with the same question early in their investing careers.\n\nBuffett initially bought VERY cheap businesses\nAnd these cheap investments gave him some of his best returns EVER (on smaller amounts of capital).\n\nHe would later call these ""fair businesses at GREAT prices.""\n\nThey were ""fair"" because they often had problems with management, markets, or both.\n\nBut Buffett felt they were cheap enough that he could still make a good profit.\n\nCheap Rental Properties = Fair Businesses\nIn the real estate world, the equivalent are cheap, rundown cash flow properties.\n\nThese properties are usually older and in regions or neighborhoods with flat or even declining population growth.\n\nHere you can get the best rent-to-price ratios (and cash flow). \n\nThese are also the properties that can come with headaches.\n\nBut with good management, you can overcome the headaches and still make a profit.\n\nJust be ready for a roller coaster ride of cash flow!\n\nCharlie Munger Took Buffett to School\nBuffett’s eventual business partner Charlie Munger convinced him to change gears.\n\nInstead of buying “fair businesses at great prices” they started buying “great businesses at fair prices.”\n\nThis switch of strategy allowed them to buy some of their permanent and best investments, like:\n- Geico Insurance\n- Coca-Cola\n- American Express\n- BNSF Railroad\n- and more recently a large portion of Apple\n\nThis was a lower stress, long-term, buy-and-hold strategy. \n\nAnd it allowed them to safely scale Berkshire Hathaway into the behemoth corporation that it is today.\n\nGrowth Rentals – Great Properties at Fair Prices\nIn real estate, the equivalent of Munger’s “great businesses at fair prices” are growth properties. \n\nThey’re the higher quality properties in higher quality locations. They're also newer properties with fewer cap-ex issues.\n\nI have owned both growth AND cash flow rental properties. I like them both for different reasons.\n\nBut growth properties are less intuitive to analyze\nYet many investors want to use the same metrics with growth properties as they do with cheaper, cash flow properties.\n\nAnd then they get frustrated when there is no positive cash flow with small down payments (or after a  BRRRR deal). \n\nOr they walk away from deals because they can’t buy them at ""big enough"" discounts.\n\nBut like Munger and Buffett's quality businesses, I’ve learned that growth properties are also excellent investment's.\n\nYou just have to apply a different analysis lens to find “good deals.”\n\nGrowth Deal Metrics\nI like to evaluate unleveraged yields on all my rentals - whether it's single family, multifamily, or commercial.\n\nUnleveraged yield = net operating income / total cost\n\nMy quality property purchases in Clemson, South Carolina the last couple of years have been 5-6% yields. \n\nIf we pay cash for them (which we do sometimes), we're happy with that base return. \n\nOr if we have private investors, they're happy with that return.\n\nBut we also expect growth.\n\nHow much? \n\nTypically 3% on the low end to 5% on the high end. \n\nWhich would give us an 8% to 11% total return (without leverage).\n\nThat'll do.  Especially with lower risk. \n\nNegative Leverage Means Low Cash-on-Cash Yield\nThe days of easily buying 7% yields with 4% debt are over.\n\nAnd that just means most real estate investors are buying with negative leverage.\n\nOur debt usually costs more than our unleveraged yield. \n\nSo, to make 7-8% financing work on these deals, down payments have to  be big\n\nLike 40-50% big.  \n\nAnd the cash-on-cash returns won't be impressive as a result.\n\nLeverage Distorts Real Estate Analysis\nBut why decide to do a deal based on cash-on-cash return, anyway?\n\nThat's why we start the analysis WITHOUT leverage.\n\nThe benefit of leverage in this case just allows us to control a quality property with fixed-interest debt. \n\nIf rents, prices, and interest rates  go up, we'll be happy even with an 8% debt.\n\nIf rents and prices stay flat but interest rates fall, we'll refinance at lower rates.\n\nAnd if something else weird happens, we'll adjust and figure it out. \n\nThat's why we keep big cash reserves and lower loan-to-value ratios.\n\nTo me, leverage makes sense when a deal is already solid. \n\nBut when you always start with leverage, it distorts that fundamental analysis. \n\nThe Boring Buy-and-Hold Strategy\nI'm sure other people have names for it, but I’ve been calling this quality property strategy the “Boring Buy-and-Hold Strategy.”\n\nOr the “Pretty Properties in the Path of Progress” strategy.\n\nPatience is the primary virtue needed to win this game.\n\nIt’s not for everyone. \n\nCash flow investing (or value-adds where you can do both!) still makes sense. \n\nBut MANY real estate investors should be pursuing this approach instead of chasing cash flow yields ...\n\nEspecially those who have more money than free time and need lower hassle deals (looking at you medical professionals, lawyers, nurses, tech professionals, engineers, etc)\n\nGetting your head around boring buy-and-hold deals requires the same mindset Warren Buffett learned from Charlie Munger.\n\nAnd when you make the shift, it opens a whole different world of real estate investments!","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/AI1cFKXXwr"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GM8TpAiWEAE9-7R?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GM8TpAiWEAE9-7R?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",19,5,7,0,5,2195,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1787670648396935370"

THAT'S going to cost thousands of dollars.""\n\n""And then I noticed the entire complex looks like crap. A tree branch against the roof in one spot. Tenants left part of a pet fence in the yard. The bushes are overgrown""\n\n""And our handyman said another unit has a tenant with a dog who's just trashed his place. Smells like urine.""\n\n""Tommy, I'm leaning towards just selling the entire property, right now.""\n\nTommy just listened patiently.\n\nThen he paused and said ""it sounds like you're one of those motivated landlords.""\n\n😕\n\n*guilty*\n\nSee, for years we've been buying properties from motivated landlords in this EXACT emotional state.\n\nAnd just so you know, we bought those properties at LOW prices and on GREAT terms to help those landlords get rid of those same negative feelings.\n\nSo, Tommy was nicely telling me ""Chad, you're in a complainy-pants downward spiral and you're not helping anything.""\n\nBut being a complainy-pants felt justified because there was a lot of truth to my complaints.\n\nThose WERE real problems!\n\nBut unfortunately, my complaining didn't help solve any of them.\n\nInstead, it put me in a negative, non-creative mental state. And the only ""logical"" solution I could think of was ...\n\nselling one of our best long-term properties.\n\n🤦🏻\n\nI'm sharing this, because you've probably been there, too. And if you haven't, you will!\n\nOwning rentals will test you mentally and emotionally.\n\nYou're going to face challenges that will make you want to quit (i.e. sell).\n\nAnd while selling can be the right move sometimes, it's almost never the right move when you're in the middle of a downward emotional spiral.\n\nEven if you want to sell, solve the problems FIRST, be patient, and sell when the time is right.\n\nBy the end of my 10-minute phone conversation with Tommy, I escaped my downward spiral.\n\nI started asking questions like:\n\n""What's the NEXT smallest thing we can do right now to solve this problem?""\n\nI repeated that question for my long list of complaints and created a to-do list.\n\nThen I started DOING those next smallest things.\n\nThe problems didn't go away immediately, but my anxiety did.\n\nAnd my desire to sell this property magically disappeared as fast as Mr. Complainy-Pants did.","[]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",10,0,3,1,1,1761,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1815465910150590612"

If you want to be rich, Louis, you need to learn to live on less than you earn.  \n\nIf you earn $40,000, live on less than $40,000.”  \n\n“Got it, Louis?”  \n“Got it!”  \n\n“Next, you need to earn $80,000. But you need to still live on $40,000.”  \n\n“Got it, Louis?”  \n“Got it!”  \n\n“Finally, you need to earn $120,000. But you need to still live on $40,000.”  \n\n“Got it, Louis?”  \n“Yes, got it!”  \n\n“Louis, if you keep doing that, you can’t help but become rich. And it will happen faster than you think.”  \n\nThe point of the story: Grow your SAVINGS GAP. It's the magic of building wealth quickly and steadily.   \n\nYet Louis’ old mentor knew that most young people inflate their lifestyle over time.  As they earn more money, they spend more at the same time.  \n\nThis LIFESTYLE INFLATION, more than anything, destroys their chances to build wealth quickly.  \n\nSo, do you want to become rich?! \n\nIf so, how is YOUR savings gap?  \n\nAnd how can you EARN more and SPEND less to increase the gap?","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/sa1aExGiBm"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZsgI0IXQAckmWm?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GZsgI0IXQAckmWm?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","CoachChadCarson","Chad Coach Carson","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1707953988715302912/nHYbTb6j_normal.jpg","null","null","null",10,2,0,0,0,922,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CoachChadCarson/status/1845104093259297212"
