"1719887650688282786","2023-11-02 09:22:24 +08:00","Learn With Me\n\nI’m often asked how I quickly synthesize information and form opinions. The value, to me, of doing this can be summarized as follows:\n\n- Be more informed about technology, markets and the economy.\n- Improve my situational awareness about trends and competitors. \n- Have a clearer picture of how a company or sector is doing over another.\n- Make better decisions.\n\nI’ve now systematized this into a product that I can share with you, to the extent you are interested.\n\nRead below for more details…\n\nThe world is complex and moves at a rapid pace. One day, climate change is all the news; the next day, it's how AI is on the verge of upending everything we know about everything; then we need to become experts in superconductors because some meaningful breakthrough may be at hand. \n\nMeanwhile, the geopolitical chaos in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia seems to be omnipresent and is constantly challenging the existing world order. Finally, we want to know what all of this means for the economy and the companies we work at or are invested in.\n\nIt’s hard to make sense of all of this, especially as the incentives of the mainstream media have become increasingly difficult to understand. So how do I form opinions? How do I learn complex topics quickly, usefully, and then fold that into a usable framework?\n\nI start with consuming content. Everything from news articles to social media to scientific papers to institutional research to YouTube videos. \n\nMost topics I skim and move onwards from, but for certain topics, where it makes sense, I write a quick 1-2 page essay because I feel it may be important. I do this so I can develop a quick point of view and understand the nuances a little bit better.\n\nWhen something seems super interesting, I select it for a dive deep with my team, where we allocate at least a month or two to thoroughly understand the key drivers and opportunities, and produce a presentation that captures everything we’ve learned.\n\nWe then take our work and review it with a set of smart people and key opinion leaders to challenge and refine our views. Historically, these work products have been very educational to me. I suspect they could be educational to others as well.\n\nSo, to this point, I have decided to share more of the work that we do at Social Capital so that if you want to, you can learn along with us.\n\nHere’s the plan:\n\n1. I’ll keep posting my daily thoughts and observations on X.\n\n2. I’ll continue to share a summary of the best content that I consumed in the previous week through my weekly newsletter ‘What I Read This Week’.\n\n3. I’ll publish 1-2 quick essays per month on X and on my weekly newsletter ‘What I Read This Week’.\n\n4. Once per month, I’ll host a Spaces to talk about the content we’ve produced, thoughts on the “current thing”, talk to guests and include time for Q&A. This will be the key feature of my Subscription on X. You can subscribe to me on X, and my first Spaces will be in November.\n\n5. Once per month, I will publish a deep dive. This will be a comprehensive slide deck on a topic with an accompanying write-up.\n\nMy Deep Dives:\n\nI've structured my deep dives around five primary themes I believe are useful for understanding the world today. These themes will change over time, but it’s important to have a starting point.\n\n1. Deep Tech: I think about “deep tech” as applying science to take things that are scarce and make them abundant, overcoming major scientific and engineering challenges. Such progress often results in significant leaps forward in our capabilities and lays the groundwork for new businesses. It's vital to track these developments to see the potential world in the next decade.\n\n2. Energy Transition: The global energy transition will reallocate trillions in capital expenditure, reorganize U.S. industry, replumb global supply chains, and more. To understand the trajectory of the world and make informed decisions about where to invest your time and efforts, a grasp on energy transition is critical.\n\n3. Healthcare & Life Sciences: Healthcare spending constitutes ~20% of U.S. GDP and shapes the primary demographic shifts influencing economic progress. For example, global GDP diminishes by ~15% due to premature deaths in the working-age population. With new technologies like MRNA and CRISPR, new drugs like GLP1s, and the challenges posed by aging, overweight or sick populations, understanding healthcare and life sciences is as important as it’s ever been.\n\n4. Economic Analysis: In 2021, we saw nearly every business model receive funding. In 2023, capital markets have been much more constrained, and many companies are struggling. Understanding how and why companies receive funding and why certain businesses are valued more than others is important for understanding how technology can be implemented in an economically productive way.\n\n5. Socio-Political Trends: This is the overlay that ties everything together, from the demographic trends that drive consumption habits, to political trends that can act as a headwind or tailwind to economic growth.\n\nI’ll be publishing our first deep dive on December 1st for free, starting with a teardown of the global energy transition. The full content calendar for the next year is outlined below, however, subscribers will be able to comment on what they want to be covered in future months. I’ll make sure to announce next month’s topic in advance so you know exactly what’s coming up.\n\nYou should expect beautifully formatted, easy to understand presentations that assume no prior knowledge, with accompanying write-ups that will get you up to speed quickly on each of these topics. \n\nIf you are interested, subscribe to my Substack (link in bio) where I will be enabling paid subscriptions in the coming month.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and opinions expressed above are current as of the date of this document and are subject to change without notice. Materials referenced above will be provided for educational purposes only. None of the above will include investment advice, a recommendation or an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities or investment products.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/zMfucMxOqe"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F95CVI9b0AAz8ur?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F95CVI9b0AAz8ur?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/zMfucMxOqe"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F95CruUaUAAz921?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F95CruUaUAAz921?format=png&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/zMfucMxOqe"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F95DO7KakAAZIsO?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F95DO7KakAAZIsO?format=png&name=orig""}]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",9079,3074,8308,142,932,3920427,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1719887650688282786"

"1773142433335025704","2024-03-28 08:17:54 +08:00","Earlier this week on Spaces, someone asked me about how poker has informed my view of business risk. In short, profoundly.\n\nPoker is a fundamentally defensive game when played at an elite level. A defensive game doesn’t mean you can’t generate huge profits. In fact, poker can yield enormous profits but the way it happens is unintuitive to most.\n\nMaximum profits in poker, and other defensive games for that matter, occur when your error rate is less than your opponent’s error rate.\n\nSo their errors - your errors = your profit. If you minimize your errors, you maximize your potential profit.\n\nThis simple formula forces you to learn that a lot of the time, the biggest enemy of your success is you. By managing yourself in a predictable, reliable way, you give yourself time for your opponent to self-own themselves. This is true in poker, but it is even more true in business.\n\nAs an example, suppose you have an R&D budget and you’re trying to build a product. Once you have some initial product market fit, the most important thing to do is to allocate your remaining resources in a thoughtful way.\n\nYou should have many small bets that extend the product area. If any one of these fail, it won’t be life-threatening and you will have learned something that will reduce your future error rate. These small bets can then ladder into a few medium-sized bets which ultimately lead to a few large bets. In such a process, you’ve not only taken many bets, of various sizes, you’ve also done this over a long quantum of time. In that same time, a less organized competitor will eventually do something wrong/stupid/both. \n\nSaid differently, you’ve de-risked your error rate in a thoughtful methodical way and have evidence that things are working while giving your competitor enough time to flail and eventually fail.\n\nIn so many companies that I’ve invested in and companies that I’ve worked for, I’ve seen enormous bets being made too early, and mostly out of ego. These bets are rarely rooted in data and most have eventually been rolled back.\n\nThe second thing to understand in poker is that when you make many small bets, you can play more hands - and some of these can lead to huge pots. Some of the biggest pots I’ve won have been with 2-2 and 8-6 suited while some of the biggest pots I’ve lost are with A-A! \n\nIn business, as in poker, you have to make unconventional bets if you want to win huge pots. And the no-brainer bets are rarely big winners and can sometimes come back and sting you. So as an investor, by keeping my bets small I keep my errors small while giving myself a chance to win big by doubling and tripling down at the right time.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",3599,442,2519,77,165,718769,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1773142433335025704"

But have you ever stopped and wondered how a rocket even works?

We have tried to break down every aspect of space, from the basic physics of how and why rockets enter orbit, to the legacy and emerging business models being built around space, to the evolving plans for lunar and deep space exploration.\n\nSeparately, in putting together this deck, I came away optimistic for America and the future of technological progress.

In 2020, she participated in the attempted defenestration of esteemed University of Chicago economist Harald Uhlig for the crime of publicly opposing the “defund the police” movement. She called for Uhlig’s removal from the classroom, claiming that he had made an insensitive remark about Martin Luther King, Jr. (The university closed its own inquiry after concluding that there was “not a basis” to investigate further.) Uhlig, in a 2022 op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, asked the pertinent question: Under the leadership of an ideologue such as Lisa Cook, would the Fed continue to pursue its mandate, or succumb to left-wing activism?\n\nTime will tell if the gears of justice turn against Lisa Cook, or if repeated academic misconduct, defended by some as mere sloppiness or isolated mistakes, is fast becoming an acceptable part of the academic order—as long as the alleged author of that behavior is favored by the powerful.”\n\nAnother reminder that movements of any kind that seek uniformity vs diversity, of any kind, are snakes that eventually eat themselves.\n\nhttps://t.co/lxFjzvdC7N","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1145,112,107,5,67,407886,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1778098007625572487"

When asked by someone to do something, I would do it.\n\nWhen asked to build a deck, I did it. And obsessed about every word, transition, image and animation until I felt it was pixel perfect. This took time.\n\nWhen asked to build a model, not only did I try to understand the purpose, I made the model flexible, structurally sound and elegant. This took time.\n\nWhen asked to work on a project, I took it on head first, developed some sense of it and then wrote a few pages explaining what I had learned and why it may be valuable as the project went forward, or didn't. This took time.\n\nMeanwhile, I didn't have time to gossip, I didn't have time to make friends at work, I didn't have time to complain.\n\nI made myself indispensable to my superiors by being a reliable worker. They then took me into the rooms they were in because I was essential to them doing well. Eventually, as they transitioned further upwards, I took command of the rooms they used to run. \n\nThis is how the process is supposed to work. \n\nSo if you want to get into the rooms where it happens, don't complain and don't get distracted.

Depending on the court's final ruling, Google could be forced to break up its search business or modify its agreements to foster competition with other search engines.\n\nWhile Google intends to appeal the decision, the ruling sets a significant precedent for future antitrust cases against other major technology companies.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",603,49,81,3,28,186962,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1822740594185347295"

These vibration frequencies correlate with the tension in the artery walls, which directly relates to the blood pressure within the vessel. By analyzing these frequency changes, researchers can accurately calculate blood pressure without using the conventional cuff-based method.\n\nThis device, currently in the prototype phase, could make blood pressure readings more accessible for both home and clinical use.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","1822740596500619434","null","null",184,15,30,2,7,84685,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1822740599545671701"

The Department of Justice argues that this gives Google undue influence over the process of bidding, serving, and placement of online ads, enabling it to extract disproportionate profits from both advertisers and publishers.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",417,37,70,3,27,164894,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1832875464836202599"
"1832875469282115707","2024-09-09 04:15:39 +08:00","Opdivo is a novel immunotherapy drug that treats certain forms of cancer. It works by blocking a protein on specific immune cells, enabling the immune system to attack cancer cells it would normally ignore. This allows the body's natural defenses to recognize and destroy cancer more effectively.\n\nHowever, a year's supply of Opdivo at its list price costs more than $150,000.\n\nWhy is the price so high?\n\nDeveloping innovative cancer drugs like Opdivo requires substantial investment in research, extensive clinical trials, and complex regulatory approval processes, often costing billions of dollars.\n\nGiven the high costs and low success rates associated with drug development, companies and investors set high prices for successful drugs like Opdivo to recover their investments and earn a return that justifies the risk they took.\n\nThe price also reflects Opdivo's potential to be a life-saving treatment, which creates high demand despite the cost.\n\nAnd as a targeted therapy, Opdivo may only be effective for a small subset of patients, leading to even higher prices to generate enough return from a smaller customer base.\n\nThus, in many cases where there is drug innovation and a potentially life-saving treatment, it often comes with a high price tag for patients and our healthcare system.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","1832875467239809256","null","null",90,3,14,2,10,70232,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1832875469282115707"

"1841155884266782771","2024-10-02 00:39:04 +08:00","Deep Dive: Is India the Next Economic Giant?\n\nAround 20 years ago, China experienced a period of unprecedented economic growth and technological advancement. I watched many of my friends invest early in China and achieve remarkable success.\n\nYet, I didn't make a single investment then. Why?\n\nI didn't feel like I understood China. I couldn't speak the language, I didn't grasp the political landscape, and I felt like an outsider looking in.\n\nWhen I look at India, I feel entirely different about it. India's democratic ideals align well with those of the United States. Many Indians speak English, which removes the language barrier, and there are favorable conditions for American entrepreneurs and investors to create successful businesses.\n\nAround 2016, when India launched UPI (digital payment system), a few of my friends and I made some bets then. Even though UPI was a huge success, in hindsight, 2016 was too early to invest in India and my bets didn’t pay off. Even though we saw a wave of successful startups like Flipkart and Zomato emerge during that time, in many ways, India's startup ecosystem was still nascent.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/KLVFYWgy6v"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY0YG4FX0AEHinn?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY0YG4FX0AEHinn?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",4507,630,3189,71,213,1005413,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1841155884266782771"
"1841155887152468329","2024-10-02 00:39:05 +08:00","Today, India feels very different from how it was in 2016. Even though some of the same fundamental characteristics remain (e.g., the world's largest working-age population, many talented and educated individuals), the tectonic plates of India's economy have shifted significantly in the past eight years, and many of the long-standing obstacles that were holding back India's economic growth have been addressed.\n\nAll this to say, through my own experience of investing in India, I realized that focusing on narrow aspects (e.g., momentum of investment in Indian startups) is necessary but insufficient.  It is understanding how the structural pieces of India’s economy fit together that offers the clearest understanding of where India’s economy is today and if it’s the next economic giant.\n\nMany articles have been written about India’s economic potential, but every article I came across, I felt that it was missing this foundational and multi-dimensional approach.\n\nThis deep dive builds a foundational understanding of India, from the lens of its economic potential. We will discuss India’s history, governance, demographic profile, technology sector, financial sector, infrastructure, and geopolitical position, to help you understand where India is in its economic development.\n\nWe assume the reader has no prior knowledge of India. One of our goals for this deep dive is to come at the subject with the right entry point, so you can develop an enduring perspective that you can build upon over time. If you don’t know very much about India, one sign we’ve done our job is that if, after reading this deep dive, the subject of India should feel less impenetrable (like China was for me), so you have the right footing to read news about India, meaningfully participate in discussions about India, and form a nuanced worldview.\n\nLater, we will do more deep dives on India that branch out and dive into specific topics, with this one as the base.\n\nOne thing I want to say is that my team and I spend a lot of time and energy to create an enjoyable reading experience. Our deep dives are designed to be read in one go, like a flip book. If we’ve done our job well, after 20-30 minutes of reading, you should be able to form a clear picture of where India stands in terms of its economic potential.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/iyuxUTjzih"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY0YboYWQAQ3t3I?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GY0YboYWQAQ3t3I?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","1841155884266782771","null","null",434,51,222,3,13,86729,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1841155887152468329"

This rapid turnaround of the booster is crucial for SpaceX's goal of enabling frequent, cost-effective launches.\n\nThe Starship upper stage also demonstrated its capability to separate from the booster and continue its mission independently.\n\nAdditionally, Starship's thermal protection system was upgraded, including more robust heat shield tiles, a backup protective layer, improved tile mounting, and enhanced protection for vulnerable areas.\n\nThese advancements bring SpaceX closer to its goals of supporting NASA's Artemis program for lunar missions, enabling Mars missions, and offering commercial space flights.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",2061,133,167,5,42,219530,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1845584870145135082"

"1850751963215933838","2024-10-28 12:10:27 +08:00","Researchers at Yale have discovered how visual clutter affects brain function. Their study shows that when our field of vision is cluttered, it changes how efficiently our brain processes information, though the basic pattern of information transfer remains the same.\n\nHow does the brain handle visual information, and why does clutter make it harder to process what we see?\n\nOur visual cortex contains smaller processing units within larger brain regions, each handling specific aspects of visual information. When we look at something, these units work together to process what we see.\n\nHowever, when our environment is visually cluttered, these units have to divide their resources across too many visual inputs at once, reducing their efficiency. This scattered attention makes it harder for our brain to focus on any single item, remember information clearly, or handle multiple tasks effectively. The brain responds to this strain by producing more stress hormones. \n\nhis research is particularly relevant today, as we increasingly interact with visually complex environments and it could lead to better ways to manage and process visual information in our daily lives.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","1850751958715367835","null","null",186,22,84,5,15,73551,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1850751963215933838"

"1853132396994150736","2024-11-04 01:49:27 +08:00","Scientists may have discovered a new explanation for how overeating leads to type II diabetes.\n\nThe current scientific consensus is that obesity leads to type II diabetes because excess stored fat causes cells to become resistant to insulin. When cells fail to respond to insulin signals, blood sugar rises, forcing the pancreas to produce more insulin to compensate. Eventually, this system breaks down, leading to type II diabetes.\n\nBut researchers at Rutgers may have discovered that type II diabetes develops differently than the consensus understanding.\n\nTheir hypothesis is that when people overeat fatty foods, it triggers the body's stress response, causing stored fat to break down too quickly and flood the body with harmful fatty acids. This process overwhelms the body and creates metabolic stress, which leads to insulin resistance and ultimately type II diabetes.\n\nTo prove their hypothesis, the researchers genetically engineered mice that lacked the enzyme needed to produce stress hormones in their body tissues. When these genetically engineered mice were fed a high-fat diet that would normally lead to obesity and insulin resistance, they did not develop insulin resistance or type II diabetes.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","1853132394813084130","null","null",280,16,70,2,27,89796,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1853132396994150736"

The Los Angeles Times, for example, is restructuring its editorial approach, as its owner Patrick Soon-Shiong recently appeared on Fox News to outline the newspaper's plans to increase diversity of viewpoints in coverage and separate more clearly between news and opinion.\n\nThe shift also extends to social media, where influencers are increasingly open about conservative views, suggesting that association with conservative positions and politically affiliated merchandise like the red MAGA hat is seen less as a liability for a business's brand value.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",3381,266,345,17,93,390794,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1858374597466579371"

This record is stored through chemical modifications that affect which genes are activated (called epigenetic changes), which influences cell behavior.\n\nWhen studying both humans and mice, the researchers found that these epigenetic changes persist even after successful weight loss and when overall health otherwise appears to return to normal. In their experiments with mice, the mice that had previously been obese gained weight more quickly when given high-fat foods compared to mice that had never been obese.\n\nThis helps explain why many people who lose weight often regain it – their fat cells retain a molecular ""memory"" of their previous obese state.\n\nThese findings are important because they show that obesity causes lasting changes in fat tissue that don't simply reverse with weight loss. This discovery could lead to new treatments that target these epigenetic changes in fat cells, potentially making it easier for people to maintain weight loss in the future.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","1860871806573543470","null","null",885,83,165,13,36,180951,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1860871808284577821"

In this case, see that when you buy an index of 500 companies, you’re really buying 10 companies with 490 others thrown in. \n\nIf there is any market volatility, the lack of diversification could cause massive impairment.\n\nThat’s ok if you’re a “professional” and that’s what you are betting on but most ETF buyers aren’t professional stock traders and they will be in for a rude awakening if this isn’t addressed.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","1871193259709432299",8726,820,3304,317,1232,4460455,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1873144394100187263"

Listing them here:\n\n1) Let’s give 1% probability to all the conspiracy theories upfront so we can address it and move on. If it is possible for China/Chinese companies to use shell companies in Singapore or other countries to be a “beard” to buy otherwise export controlled chips from Nvidia and use them for AI training, this likely needs to be investigated and adjudicated.\n\n2) The battle of usage is now more about AI inference vs Training. We always knew this day would come but it probably surprised many that it could be this weekend. With a model this cheap, many new products and experiences can now emerge trying to win the hearts and minds of the global populace. Team USA needs to win here. To that point, while we may still want to export control AI Training chips, we should probably view Inference chips differently - we should want everyone around the world using our solutions over others. I can explain my reasoning as follows: we should never export our knowledge of enriching uranium to be weapons grade to other countries but we should export our ability to build nuclear energy (which requires far less sophistication) if it can help advance American priorities and leadership abroad. Training and Inference can be roughly equated this way. (Disclaimer: Groq, of which I’m a shareholder, is in this game so this benefits me tbf.)\n\n3) We need to cooperate with our allies (especially those in the ME) to stand up the necessary infrastructure to enable Inference - Data centers, subsidized energy etc. all around the world ASAP.. They pay to build it, we supply the Inference hardware and the software to run the clouds. We need this buildout to happen ASAP. This is clearly our version of Belt and Road and we need to take it as seriously as China took their version, similarly named.\n\n4) There will be volatility in the stock market as capital markets absorb all of this information and re-price the values of the Mag7. Tesla is the least exposed, the rest are exposed as a direct function of the amount of CapEx they have publicly announced. Nvidia is the most at risk for obvious reasons. That said, markets will love it if Meta, Microsoft, Google etc can win WITHOUT having to spend $50-80B PER YEAR. \n\n5) The innovation from China speaks to how “asleep” we’ve been for the past 15 years. We’ve been running towards the big money/shiny object spending programs (AI is not the first and it likely won’t be the last) where we (Team USA) have thrown hundreds of billions of dollars at a problem vs thinking through the problem more cleverly and using resource constraints as an enabler. Let’s get our act together. We need all the bumbling middle managers out of the way - let the engineers and the brilliant folks we have actually working on this stuff to cook! More spending, more meetings, more oversight, more weekly reports and the like does not equate to more innovation. Unburden our technical stars to do their magic. \n\n6) Startups need to realize that they are “default dead” companies. This means that they must, by definition, grasp victory from the jaws of defeat. Meanwhile, VCs are asleep at the switch - massively overfunding marginal ideas. We need to get better at taking huge shots on goal and allocating capital to the best of these ideas. I worry that in this current melee, we’ve overspent billions on dumb features which these next-gen models will roll over in the next 12months or earlier. Lots of capital losses are coming.\n\nCrazily, I initially posted about DeepSeek a month ago!\n\nComments/reactions appreciated.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","1873253863022588109",5523,776,3744,211,302,1756517,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1883571504153309377"
"1883579259769462819","2025-01-27 02:14:25 +08:00","This report is long but very good. \n\n“With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems.\n\nThe technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to ""reward hacking"" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried.”\n\nhttps://t.co/XRqgMNRzg1","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",12453,1730,8071,219,248,2294402,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1883579259769462819"

The thread highlights this quite well. \n\nThe bottom line is that none of us ACTUALLY know. We have our own biases of what we’d like to be true. \n\nIf we’ve spent tens of billions on nvidia, we NEED it to be true that the only way to improvements in AI is through more nvidia GPUs. \n\nIf we have started or have a large economic interest in an nvidia competitor (full disclosure this is the camp I’m in) or can’t raise tens of billions for nvidia capex, we want the opposite to be true. \n\nSo, in short, YMMV as you read the “news” over these next few weeks but at least you can see both sides here on X and come to your own conclusion. \n\nMy two cents are that DeepSeek has found some key innovations (algorithmic through GRPO and bypassing CUDA) that everyone will and should copy. Second, it also seems highly unlikely that Singapore is actually absorbing all of the nvidia GPUs that go there and is a waystation for avoiding export controls. Highly likely that this hole will be closed in short order. \n\nThe rest will get figured out by the market as more models are released and more production workflows embrace these various solutions. \n\nGood luck out there!","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","1885306497346752672",752,78,339,13,65,285889,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1885734089652838668"

Looking at the full year though, inflation showed improvement, decreasing from 3.8% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2024.\n\nPowell noted that the U.S. labor market remained healthy with unemployment steady at 4.1%, though he also commented that companies have slowed down their hiring.\n\nPowell's overall tone on Wednesday was one of cautious optimism – with annual GDP growth at 2.8% and inflation falling to 2.5% from 3.8%, he sees the economy in a ""good place"" but wants to see more consistent progress on bringing inflation down before making any changes to the federal funds rate.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",812,54,150,1,25,216850,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1885759218575106503"

You can’t count on the Fed so they will have to do it themselves. \n\nThe question is how far they are willing to go.\n\nSimplistically, the only way the markets give them cheaper financing is if they make big cuts - spending and regulation. But at the same time, the cuts need to be surgical. \n\n70% of our GDP is still consumer driven so big spending projects that DONT touch consumers seems on target. But anything that touches consumers may need to be looked at more surgically because if prices rise into spending cuts and deregulation it could get very complicated. \n\nThe deportation picture gets murky in this scenario. As does tariffs. But unleashing energy and creating as many sources of competition for electrons is a no brainer.\n\nApologies for the stream of consciousness. I’ll post my thoughts in a digestible way shortly.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","1887287970828292193",1254,85,287,24,63,453486,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1887552288170127593"

"1888268283079532770","2025-02-09 00:46:55 +08:00","A Conversation with One of My 8090 Co-Founders\n\nI talked to @sinasojoodi, one of my co-founders at 8090, after we published our Deep Dive on AI last week. Let me know if this is interesting to you.\n\nChamath:\nThere’s this great story of how OpenAI accidentally discovered LLMs. Walk me through what happened there.\n\nSina:\nLLM Grokking – this is funny. It's almost like how penicillin was discovered.\n\nOpenAI made this discovery where typically in traditional machine learning, there's a point of overfitting, where you stop training because the model is just memorizing the training set rather than learning to generalize.\n\nBut OpenAI accidentally ran their experiment for days instead of hours, well beyond this overfitting point. And they reached what they call the 'grokking zone', where somehow, even though the training should have been completed many times over, the model started to actually understand concepts and show emergent behaviors beyond memorization.\n\nThis discovery completely changed how we approach training transformer models. Instead of following traditional machine learning wisdom to avoid overfitting, we now know that transformers actually benefit from training far beyond conventional limits. And the scaling laws that emerged from this work give us precise formulas for the resources needed – parameters, compute, and data – to reach these emergent capabilities.\n\nThey discovered this phenomenon, basically by accident. And that's the story of deep learning, to some degree. It's more about trial and error and trying a bunch of stuff than theory, although having a mental model for how it works does help.\n\nChamath:\nRecently, I decided to use the word ""brain"" instead of saying ""AI"". What are your thoughts on that analogy?\n\nSina:\nThe first thing that comes to mind is the incredible complexity of neurons in the human brain. Each biological neuron is like its own universe of computation. It's doing these incredibly complex operations, it has its own learning mechanisms, and it maintains its own state. When we talk about the brain having 100 trillion connections between biological neurons, in some sense, that number doesn't even capture the full power of a human brain because each biological synapse is its own sophisticated processor.\n\nArtificial neural networks took inspiration from this but went in a different direction. We simplified our artificial neurons down to basic weights and biases – basically 'y = Wx + b'. While artificial neural networks might have billions of artificial neurons, each one is just doing these elementary mathematical operations: multiply inputs by weights, add a bias, run through an activation function.\n\nThe trade-offs between these approaches are stark. Biological brains excel at power efficiency but operate in milliseconds, while artificial neurons can process information billions of times faster on H100s but consume massive amounts of energy to do so.\n\nThe learning mechanisms are fundamentally different too. Nature spent a billion years evolving these incredibly sophisticated biological systems, while we're trying to accelerate that evolution with artificial neurons through massive computational parallelism and gradient descent. Both approaches work, just in fundamentally different ways: biological evolution through natural selection over eons versus algorithmic optimization over weeks of training.\n\nIt reminds me of the whole birds and airplanes parallel. Both achieve flight, but through completely different engineering approaches.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",462,53,341,10,93,136912,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1888268283079532770"

This improves safety while enabling tighter component packaging, which increases energy density for longer vehicle range.\n\nThe solid electrolytes also resist degradation during repeated charging cycles and withstand higher voltage differentials, both of which enable faster charging capabilities.\n\nBYD's achievement places them among frontrunners like Toyota, QuantumScape, and CATL in developing this technology.\n\nHowever, all manufacturers face challenges in scaling production. The industry struggles with manufacturing complexity, material costs, and ensuring consistent performance across large-scale production – obstacles that have repeatedly delayed commercial releases despite promising announcements.\n\nBYD plans a ""mass demonstration"" of the technology by 2027, with full commercial-scale production likely following after 2030.\n\nThe company's strategy involves initially deploying these advanced batteries in high-end vehicles where premium pricing can offset higher production costs.\n\nMeanwhile, BYD will continue using their established lithium iron phosphate batteries for mainstream markets for 15 to 20 years as solid-state technology becomes more affordable.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1509,86,393,2,56,344080,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1894163243393810672"

The government takes from you equally. \n\nMay sound ok to some but those are people without agency or desire to get ahead. \n\nIncome taxes incentivize mediocrity and is a headwind to getting ahead. \n\nSeparately, but this is for another post, in a post-AI world, the idea of taxing incomes makes no sense anyways and we will be forced to substitute income taxes for consumption taxes. \n\nSo, let’s get ahead of the curve and try taxing companies and outsiders who want access to the US market and substitute it for income taxes and slowly take them to zero. \n\nThis is, by the way, how it used to be for 126 years of our country (1776-1861, 1872-1913). \n\nWho does this hurt?\n\n1) Asset holders. If you own stocks, you dislike this. If you don’t own stocks or care about the S&P500, bottom line, you would be better off. \n\n2) Globalism. If you like the idea of a gargantuan, worldwide free trade zone, this hurts you because the status quo today likes to take from citizens and reward companies and global free trade instead. \n\n3) Muscular federal spending. If you believe that bureaucrats have the answer and can spend their way to solve problems on behalf of Americans, you want the status quo.","[]","chamath","Chamath Palihapitiya","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1883600182165848064/-9LbG3md_normal.jpg","null","null","1895473642202394696",4733,544,627,61,291,585872,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1895948351516131515"
