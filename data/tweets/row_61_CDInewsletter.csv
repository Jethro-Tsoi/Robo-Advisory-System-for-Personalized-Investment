Couche-Tard is mostly an owner/operator, especially in North America. There's a bit of a culture/biz model difference there.\n- About 25% of 7-11 stores are located in Japan. They're neat (I was in Japan in November) but those stores are also MUCH different than North American convenience\n- I wouldn't be surprised if the strategy is to buy all of Seven and I, keep the non-Japanese assets, and then sell or spin-off the Japanese stores. That would help pay off the accumulated debt\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a big nut to swallow, guys. If anyone can handle such a thing it's Couche-Tard, but we saw what happened to the stock last time it did tried to do something like this. It's also a little different biz than Couche-Tard is used to. I predict it weighs on the stock over the short-term. \n\nOn the plus side, 7-11 North America isn't a great convenience chain and Couche-Tard could really help them operationally. \n\nMuch more on this deal will be sent to premium CDI newsletter subscribers on Friday.","[]","CDInewsletter","Canadian Dividend Investing","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1620873456681160709/Y4v_oWR5_normal.jpg","null","null","null",83,8,14,0,8,13852,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CDInewsletter/status/1825528665448517932"

It can buyback shares, expand more in Canada, or look to buy something in another market -- like in the Caribbean. \n\nIt could even be as simple as TD uses its US earnings to (mostly) fund its dividend, leaving a big chunk of the Canadian earnings to expand or make acquisitions in Canada.

I was there five days a week, and someone else went on the weekend. They were about 30% of my route's business.\n\nI got paid weekly, for chips I sold the previous week, via commission. So, for example, I'd be getting paid today for chips sold Dec 2nd-6th. \n\nThe chip company, meanwhile, didn't get paid for 45 days. That's what Walmart negotiated. So for chips sold on December 2nd, Walmart would only pay for them in the middle of January. \n\nDo this over dozens of suppliers and for a long time, and we're talking tens of billions in negative working capital. Easily. \n\nSo remember, next time you go to Walmart, that most of the stuff sitting there hasn't been paid for yet.","[]","CDInewsletter","Canadian Dividend Investing","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1620873456681160709/Y4v_oWR5_normal.jpg","null","null","null",33,3,4,0,5,4764,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CDInewsletter/status/1867222376045334909"

Less than half of total distributions came from income generated by the portfolio. The rest came from capital gains and return of capital.\n\nEssentially, what it means is 57% of all distributions for the fund's first three years came from investors getting their own money back. The fund is literally selling assets to pay dividends. \n\nIt's the equivalent of collecting a 6% yield from $ENB, and then selling an additional 5.8% of units. Look guys, a ""sustainable"" 11.8% yield. I did it!\n\nPeople would laugh at me if I tried that with a straight face. Rightfully so. But add a option component to it, package it up in a fund, and suddenly it's okay. \n\nBut the only way that it can actually be sustainable, is if Enbridge goes up by 5.8% per year. Some years, like 2024, that strategy would've worked out great. Others, like 2023, it would have been supremely bad. \n\nOh, and you're also paying a 0.65% fee for HDIV to give you your own money back. Read that twice, because it should piss off any HDIV owner. \n\nHDIV also has leverage, which throws a whole other wrinkle into this. Leverage makes the good years great, but also makes the bad years terrible. That makes it much harder to pay distributions during bad years. \n\nIn short, buy this if you want. I DGAF. Just be aware that this fund -- and so many others like it -- has VERY serious flaws once you look under the hood.\n\nI'm mostly putting this out there for the next time someone tells me to invest in one of these funds. Rant over. Carry on.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/57iZNYVecw"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ggufx1iawAAik3J?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ggufx1iawAAik3J?format=png&name=orig""}]","CDInewsletter","Canadian Dividend Investing","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1620873456681160709/Y4v_oWR5_normal.jpg","null","null","null",27,3,6,0,8,4492,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CDInewsletter/status/1876773325873234143"

"1893751181232730615","2025-02-24 03:54:00 +08:00","I see a lot of hate of ""dividend bros"" on this app, grouping us all into one box. All we think about is dividends, don't care about total return, etc.\n\nBut in reality, there are many types of dividend investors, and it's pretty much impossible to group us into even a half dozen boxes. \n\nSome buy almost exclusively growth names that pay a token dividend -- things like $COST, $MCO, $WM, $MSFT, or $TRI.to and $DOL.to on the Canadian side.\n\nSome hang out more in the middle, buying mature companies offering 2-4% yields with decades-long streaks of dividend growth. These might be $MCD, $KO, $ABBV, $XOM, or $RY.to and $FTS.to in Canada.\n\nFinally, we have folks who like high yield, looking to maximize their income. Naysayers say that the only thing these folks look at is the dividend yield. While yield chasers certainly exist, I've found that many high yield investors want a little bit of growth combined with their yield. Most would much rather have a 6-8% yield plus 2-4% growth, rather than a 12% yield and negative growth. So they look at names like $O, $VZ, $MO, $PFE, or $T.to and $ENB.to in Canada.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. Some dividend investors expand into covered calls or other income-generating options strategies. Some buy over the long-term, while others are content to flip for short-term gains. Some want a certain history of dividend growth, while others don't need history (or even dividend growth) at all. \n\nThe fact is most dividend investors don't fit into any one box. Many use a combination of different strategies. \n\nFor instance, @myownadvisor and @DividendDaddy1 buy a combination of ETFs and individual dividend stocks. @Tawcan has been buying growthier dividend stocks lately, but has a base of more boring dividend names. @DividendGrowth insists on something that grows the payout over time, while @DivGrojourney is more of a value investor who appreciates a good dividend. \n\nI embrace a little more flexible path. I own a combination of all three categories above. I usually wait until stocks in each category are cheap, and that's when I pounce. No matter what type of dividend I'm buying (and I think there's value in having all three), I want to do it cheaply.  \n\nUltimately, every investor comes up with portfolio construction methods that match our risk tolerance, goals, savings rates, projected retirement date, and more. No two investors are the same. Growth investors have different strategies from their fellow growth investors. So do value investors. \n\nSo remember, the next time you see someone group every dividend investor into one tidy profile -- as folks who don't care about dividends often do -- just remember how wrong that ""analysis"" really is.","[]","CDInewsletter","Canadian Dividend Investing","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1620873456681160709/Y4v_oWR5_normal.jpg","null","null","null",116,11,39,1,21,17504,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CDInewsletter/status/1893751181232730615"

If he's born just 20 years earlier (or one country over), he doesn't get to study with Dodd and Graham. Without that, it's unlikely he becomes the best investor ever. He's just another anonymous deca-millionaire.\n\nBill Gates went to one of ~5 schools in America that had a computer in the late-60s. The odds were massively stacked against him on that front. But the rest is history. Without hundreds of hours on a computer, Gates doesn't get the idea to design software, and his life likely turns out very different.\n\nEven me, I got lucky that my Dad caught the investing bug and had time to teach me when I first started getting interested. That was hugely valuable for me. I avoided his mistakes. If I'm the prodigy of most anyone else, I don't get that advantage. \n\nI believe that as the recipient of good luck, I have the responsibility to pay it forward. That's why I tweet, and write, and talk to individual investors. I'm trying to pass on the things I've learned. My luck becomes a debt I owe to the universe, a debt I'm trying to slowly repay -- with substantial interest. \n\nHopefully this inspires a few of the anonymous Twitterers out there, folks with knowledge to spare.","[]","CDInewsletter","Canadian Dividend Investing","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1620873456681160709/Y4v_oWR5_normal.jpg","null","null","null",53,3,2,0,10,5173,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/CDInewsletter/status/1895090506993893718"
