Start saving for retirement as soon as possible - small amounts add up over time thanks to compound interest.\n\n2. Network and build connections early on - it will open up doors that a college degree cannot.\n\n3. Never let work consume your entire life. Make time for your personal life and relationships.\n\n4. Read more. Knowledge is power.\n\n5. Time is your most valuable asset. Use it wisely; you can never get lost time back.\n\n6. Don't be afraid of failure. You'll make mistakes; learn from them.\n\n7. Don't compare yourself to others. Comparison is the thief of joy - focus on your path.\n\n8. Not everyone will like you, and that's okay.\n\n9. Say 'no' more often to protect your time and energy. You can't please everyone, so stop trying.\n\n10. Most of your friends from your 20s don't stick around long-term. That's OK.\n\n11. Spend more time with your family. You'll regret not doing it more.\n\n12. You don't need to go to a prestigious school to be successful. Grades aren't everything.\n\n13. Pick your spouse carefully. Wrong choices set you back years.\n\n14. That toxic friend/partner? Cut them off sooner than later.\n\n15. Don't wait for opportunities to come to you. Go out and create them.","[]","FluentInFinance","Andrew Lokenauth | TheFinanceNewsletter.com","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1747282104990175232/DSMtFE0E_normal.jpg","null","null","null",442,83,244,2,23,74486,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/FluentInFinance/status/1825290272965833086"
