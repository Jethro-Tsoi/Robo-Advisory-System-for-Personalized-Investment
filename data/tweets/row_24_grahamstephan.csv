For a bill to pass, everyone is going to have to come to an agreement, which means, one side is going to have to compromise more than they want.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is that an agreement cannot be reached even among the Republican members.\n\nEven though I generally stay out of politics, for those who are curious exactly what this disagreement is about, it appears as though Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, has made promises to the right, ultra-right, and moderates in order to keep his job and stay in power.\n\nAs you might imagine, it's impossible to satisfy all of those demands and appease everyone, without splitting his group in half. \n\nSo, his choice is simple: \n\nTry to push through spending cuts that would be dead on arrival in the Senate, thereby causing a Government Shutdown, or, give in to the majority demand to keep the money flowing and risk his job.\n\nSomething’s going to have to give.","[]","GrahamStephan","Graham Stephan","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1068007184800215040/_gCkXkbQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",111,13,1,0,16,42953,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GrahamStephan/status/1707054775081033873"

"1710345814244200687","2023-10-07 01:26:33 +08:00","""Marry the house, date the rate""\n\nWith mortgage rates at 7% and the median mortgage payment at $2,162 per month, this is the advice that many real estate agents are giving.\n\nThe idea is simple: When rates are high, competition is low, and it's easier for you to get a house you like. Since a house is a long-term commitment, you might as well ""marry"" it. As for the high mortgage payments, they depend on the Fed rate, and if rates drop down the line, you can refinance and save on payments.\n\nBut that's a BIG if.\n\nRefinances can make sense if:\n- Your term increases, but you pay less monthly or\n- You pay more monthly, but your loan is paid off earlier\n\nOne risk with this strategy is: Buying into a house you can't afford, thinking that you can refinance at any time down the line. But if interest rates stay the same or go higher, you could be stuck paying huge monthly payments for a long time. Housing is everyone's biggest expense and it might burn a hole in your pocket.\n\nThe other risk is panic-buying into an overvalued property in a hot market. If it's a house you're going to stay in for a while, it's one thing. But cash-out refinancing is going to be a problem if the value of your home drops.\n\nFinally, refinancing isn't free – it can cost 2 to 6% of your loan amount. Even if the rate drops, a high cost of refinancing would mean that the deal isn't worth it. And if you refinance and the rate drops further, you're going to facepalm that you didn't time the bottom.\n\nNOBODY can predict interest rates, and while you could take advantage of a refinance in case rates do drop, planning your financial strategy for the next 15 to 30 years gambling on the interest rate can be a bad move.\n\nIf you're marrying the house and dating the rate, make sure it's a house you really like, and you can afford the payments even if the rates don't go your way.","[{""type"":""animated_gif"",""url"":""https://t.co/y80UDhPHI2"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/F7xeQTVbkAAxWx0.jpg?name=thumb"",""original"":""https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/F7xeQTVbkAAxWx0.mp4""}]","GrahamStephan","Graham Stephan","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1068007184800215040/_gCkXkbQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",397,45,87,3,36,230815,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GrahamStephan/status/1710345814244200687"

"1722250839295983805","2023-11-08 21:52:52 +08:00","An Airbnb host in LA let a guest stay on for a few extra days in 2022. \n\nA year and a half later, she still hadn't vacated – She paid no rent and demanded $100,000 to move out. \n\nHere's the story of ""the tenant from hell"":\n\nLet's call the landlord Bob and the tenant Jane.\n""Bob"" has been renting out his guesthouse on Airbnb since 2019. It's in a premium area in LA.\nIn late 2021, ""Jane"" approached him. She wanted a six-month stay at the guesthouse. \nThey worked out a rate of $105 per night – around $21k for 187 nights.\n\nJane seemed polite enough till her lease expired in March 2022.\nShe asked for more time, and Bob refused. But then he let her stay on till April 12 – without a lease agreement. \nThis was a terrible mistake.\nAt this point, Airbnb was out of the picture. \nJane stopped paying rent.\n\nSince then, Bob tried many things to get Jane to leave.\nHe tried moving her to a hotel to get the house repaired. \nHe offered $2,000 for moving assistance. Finally, he sued her after the deadline.\n\nThe case lasted for more than a year, and things didn't go in Bob's favor. Jane's lawyer dragged out the case saying:\n- The ADU didn't have a certificate of occupancy (BIG mistake).\n- The ADU had an unpermitted shower (Really?)\n- Jane had chemical sensitivities and COVID risk, and could not be evicted.\n- Bob's kids play loud music to harass Jane (in his own house!)\n- That Bob had no license or lease agreement – and he couldn't charge rent on the unit.\n\nThat last point seems very fishy.\nIt looks like the tenant had known all along that there were technical problems with the property, and she steered things toward a legal battle knowing the landlord wouldn't win.\nThe court favored her, and she wasn't required to move out.\nJane demanded $100,000 from Bob to move out, as a ""relocation fee.""\n\nImagine living on the same property, a few feet away, from someone you're fighting a legal battle with!\nPaparazzi followed Jane around every time she left the house.\nBob didn't feel safe living in his own house. \nThe situation was terrible for both of them.\nFinally, she vacated after 570 days – and Bob has lost $58,000 in rent.\n\nMy sympathies are with Bob here: \nI've had two bad experiences of tenants squatting for weeks and months after their lease lapsed. I couldn't get them to evict.\nOne of them even trashed the place before finally leaving, causing thousands of dollars in damage. \nBob could have avoided all this by being more careful with the legal stuff – but it looks like he was targeted and taken advantage of here.\n\nThe law favors tenants heavily. Once you lock in a tenant, it's very hard to evict them.\nSome tenants take advantage of this. They know all the loopholes and technicalities of the system. They're called ""Professional Tenants.""\nRenting out to a professional tenant can lose you thousands of dollars in rent and damages.\nWorse, it can turn your life into a stressful nightmare.\n\nI'm going to drop a step-by-step guide on how to steer clear of professional tenants. \nFollow me @grahamstephan to make sure you don't miss it.","[]","GrahamStephan","Graham Stephan","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1068007184800215040/_gCkXkbQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",218,22,46,3,30,80168,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GrahamStephan/status/1722250839295983805"

"1767558851963101493","2024-03-12 22:30:44 +08:00","Athletes are some of the highest-paid people in America.\nYet, a surprising number of them go bankrupt.\nHere's what I found and what you can do differently:\n\nIn 2009, Sports Illustrated estimated that about 60% of NBA players are broke within 5 years of retirement. 78% of NFL players file for bankruptcy just 2 years after they retire. Is this because they don't know how to handle the money and fame they haven't received all their lives? Or is it because athletes have extremely short careers compared to the average person who could work till they retire at 60? There's a bit of both, but there's a bigger reason.\n\nIt's what Morgan Housel calls ""Social Debt"": Sometimes when you're massively successful, it doesn't feel like that success is yours – it belongs to everyone who is connected to you, even remotely. Shaq earned $20M on his first paycheck. He bought a car worth $250k. \n\nBut then his dad asked for a similar car. \nHis mom asked for one too. \nHe thought that buying a $7M house was a good idea. He bought expensive gifts for his friends.\nBy the time he got the call from his accountant that $20M was less than $10M after taxes in CA, he had blown more than $8M.\n\nThis could also be why so many lottery winners tend to blow their winnings.\n\nWhat's the solution? Forget your friends when you win big?\nNot at all. \nYour life is rich because of the relationships you maintain, and beyond a point, more money isn't going to fulfill the search for meaning.\nBut don't cave to social pressure either.\n\nSomeone who upgrades their lifestyle and tries to lift everyone along with them just cannot sustain it.\nA millionaire living like a multi-millionaire and someone making minimum wage trying to live like a millionaire are going to end up the same way – broke.\n\nInstead, live a frugal lifestyle, allow yourself to enjoy good things, and focus on building financial stability.\nHelp others grow while being clear about your boundaries.\nYou can't help others if you aren't in a good place yourself.\n\nMaybe this is why Shaq tells his kids ""We ain't rich. I'm rich"". 🤣\n\nThis isn't just good advice for athletes or lottery winners though – Anyone looking to build wealth and trying to hold off on peer pressure can benefit from this approach.\n\nHow do you think you would handle a sudden lifestyle upgrade?","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/om42vvSEBF"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GIehZQYaMAEzjT2?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GIehZQYaMAEzjT2?format=png&name=orig""}]","GrahamStephan","Graham Stephan","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1068007184800215040/_gCkXkbQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",132,5,9,1,10,20104,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GrahamStephan/status/1767558851963101493"
