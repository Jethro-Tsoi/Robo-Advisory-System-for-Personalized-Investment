It’s more than 200 years old. But, before I give it to you, I want you to go to the watch shop and tell the owner you want to sell it. Ask him what price he would pay for it.”\n\nThe son went to the watch shop and then returned to his father’s bedside. He reported, “The watchmaker said he would pay $15 for the watch because it is old and scratched.”\n\nThe father then said to the son, “Go to the pawn shop and ask the owner if he’d be interested in buying the pocket watch and what he’s willing to pay.”\n\nThe son ran to the pawn shop and quickly returned. He told his father, “The pawn shop owner said he didn’t have much use for an old pocket watch but offered $20 for it.”\n\nFinally, the father told the son, “Go to the museum and show them the watch.”\n\nThe son left for the museum and returned with a look of astonishment on his face. He whispered, “Father, the curator at the museum offered me $1 million for this pocket watch!”\n\nThe father laid his head back, closed his eyes and said: \n\n“I wanted you to experience for yourself that the right place, and the right people, will value your value in the right way. Never put yourself in the wrong place, with the wrong people, and then get angry when you don’t feel valued. Don’t stay in a place, or with people, that don’t value your value. Know your worth and be confident in your own value.”\n\nThis timeless story is a great reminder that you should NEVER settle for being valued less than your worth.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/KpKCI5M2ku"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GBe-cTkasAAE5CA?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GBe-cTkasAAE5CA?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","LTI_finance","Mark Wlosinski","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1634824854905167873/WlWj3EsL_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1180,215,635,18,17,408473,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/LTI_finance/status/1736065580371960300"
