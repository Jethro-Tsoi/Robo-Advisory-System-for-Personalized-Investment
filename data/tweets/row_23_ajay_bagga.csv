"1887340055343341941","2025-02-06 11:18:28 +08:00","Global Markets Update: Navigating Tariffs, Yields, and Economic Signals\nAjay Bagga Feb 6th 7 AM India Time:\nGlobal markets exhibited a measured rebound mid-week, with steady gains across equities and bonds reflecting a temporary sense of calm after earlier volatility. The fluctuations were largely driven by renewed trade tensions as former U.S. President Donald Trump reintroduced elements of his tariff agenda, reigniting concerns about global trade dynamics.\n\nTrump Tariffs: A Renewed Trade Headwind\n\nThe reimposition of tariffs by Trump has stirred apprehension in global markets, particularly impacting sectors sensitive to international trade. While the initial shock triggered sharp market reactions, investors appear to be recalibrating their expectations, recognizing that the actual economic fallout may take time to materialize. Market participants are closely monitoring potential retaliatory measures from major trading partners, which could further disrupt supply chains and corporate earnings.\n\nUS Bond Yields: A Barometer of Economic Sentiment\n\nU.S. Treasury yields have been notably volatile, reflecting shifting investor sentiment amid evolving economic data and policy expectations. The benchmark 10-year yield has oscillated as traders digest mixed signals—balancing concerns over growth with expectations for Federal Reserve policy adjustments. A recent drift lower in yields suggests a flight to safety, underscoring investor caution as geopolitical and economic uncertainties loom.\n\nUS Jobs Data: A Crucial Indicator for Fed Policy\n\nAttention is sharply focused on Friday’s U.S. jobs report, a critical data point that could influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy trajectory. Strong employment figures may reinforce expectations of continued policy tightening, while weaker data could bolster the case for a more dovish stance. The labor market's resilience has been a cornerstone of the U.S. economic narrative, and any deviation from this trend will likely have ripple effects across asset classes.\n\nCommodity Prices: Reflecting Supply-Demand Crosscurrents\n\nCommodity markets have been equally dynamic, with prices responding to both macroeconomic factors and specific supply-demand imbalances. Oil prices remain sensitive to geopolitical developments, including Middle East tensions and OPEC+ production strategies. Meanwhile, industrial metals have been caught between global growth concerns and supply chain disruptions, while agricultural commodities face volatility driven by weather patterns and trade policy shifts.\n\nBroad Market Overview: Seeking Stability Amid Uncertainty\n\nDespite the week’s initial turbulence, U.S. equity markets closed higher on Wednesday as investors looked past trade-related turmoil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2%, and the S&P 500 advanced 0.4%. This rebound highlights the market’s resilience, though underlying caution persists. Volatility has been the prevailing theme, with market participants striving to find equilibrium amid shifting economic signals and policy uncertainties.\n\nIn summary, global markets are navigating a complex landscape marked by trade tensions, fluctuating bond yields, pivotal economic data, and commodity price volatility. Investors remain vigilant, balancing short-term market reactions with long-term economic fundamentals as they assess the evolving macroeconomic environment.","[]","Ajay_Bagga","Ajay Bagga","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1498354481767251968/69PPGlrH_normal.jpg","null","null","null",98,2,13,0,6,8313,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Ajay_Bagga/status/1887340055343341941"

"1887704208377618803","2025-02-07 11:25:29 +08:00","Indian markets have discounted a 25 bps rate cut by the RBI today. Inflation is expected to average 4.5% in Q4 FY2025, versus an average of 4.8% in the entire financial year 2024-2025. Next year, inflation is expected to be slightly lower , in the range of 4.2-4.5% . There is space for RBI to cut rates today ,given the lowering of the fiscal deficit in the Union Budget 2025. Globally, the economic growth is expected to be strong in the range of 3% to 3.25% . The Bank of Canada , Bank of England and ECB have all cut rates over the last week while the US Fed stood pat . The Bank of Japan has raised rates and has given indications of further raising rates to 1% over the next two quarters. Add to this the overlay of Trump Tariffs, which inject the uncertainty of protectionism , inflation and sharp currency moves. This raises the chance that the RBI could pause for now and wait for the initial months of Trump 2.0 to pass. We feel RBI will seize the chance to cut today, will provide more liquidity to the money markets and will keep its inflation and GDP growth targets in line with the recent Union Budget and Economic Survey. The Rupee depreciation has to be seen in a global scenario. The share of imports in India's consumption basket is around 12% . That gets impact by a lower Rupee, but offsetting this are the gains for the goods and services exports of $ 700 billion . Keeping rates at these elevated levels will not protect the rupee but will prove a continued pressure point for the Indian economy . Hence we expect a pragmatic rate cut by the RBI and three more rate cuts in the rest of the calendar year. The impact on the markets will be muted , as a rate cut is largely factored in by the markets .","[]","Ajay_Bagga","Ajay Bagga","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1498354481767251968/69PPGlrH_normal.jpg","null","null","null",391,33,25,2,23,44978,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Ajay_Bagga/status/1887704208377618803"

"1892047432139366578","2025-02-19 11:03:55 +08:00","Global Markets and India Update: Ajay Bagga, Market Veteran, Feb 19th, 8 AM India time  :                                                                                              Senior officials from the US and Russia met for 4 hours in Riyadh to kick start Ukraine-Russia peace talks. US Sec of State Rubio subsequently briefed senior diplomats from France, Germany, Italy, Britain and the EU. On the monetary front, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates for the first time in four years, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates by 50 bps this morning and the Bank Indonesia is expected to hold rates steady . The FOMC meeting minutes today will provide some insights into the Fed thought process. Overall, global investors, governments and corporations are in a ""hold and wait"" mode , as they wade through the cross-currents of geopolitical risk reduction with possible peace deals in Ukraine and the on going Middle East ceasefire extension, while facing up to changes in global supply chains and trade flows due to some form of tariffs from the Trump administration. Emerging markets debt and Chinese tech stocks are the two favoured long trades , as are physical Gold and silver based funds. More Chinese stimulus measures are expected as the NPC meets . Meanwhile, US stocks saw the S&P 500 eke out a small gain to mark another all time high level. In Fed speak,Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller reiterated that US economic strength and elevated inflation warrant holding the policy rate steady for the time being.\nSan Francisco Fed President Mary Daly concurred that a pause in rate cuts is appropriate until more visible progress is made toward bringing inflation down to the Fed's 2% goal.  In big brokerage calls, Goldman gave a thumbs up to Chinese stocks, Bank of America warned that US stock outperformance could be on its last surge before a correction later in the year, Citi and Morgan Stanley brought out positive reports on the Indian markets, calling for 26,000 levels for the Nifty by Dec 2025 on the back of structural strength and corporate capex/releveraging gaining traction. For now Indian markets are in a tight pattern, with a higher probability of a near term break downwards on the back of sustained FPI selling pressures.The Indian midcap indices are down nearly 18% from the September peaks while the small and microcap indices are already in bear market territory. The lead indices, the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex are both down around 13% from the September all time highs, marking 5 months of negative returns. The key question is , is this a correction within a structural bull market, or is a bear market imminent? Bear markets in India since 1991 have lasted around 12 months on average , the longest being around 26 months long . Bull markets last around 48-56 months, the one that peaked in September had marked 54 months . In retrospect we can draw clean lines and patterns, but looking ahead , we see a challenge to markets from the rapid cross-currents of geopolitical risk, tariff wars, competitive currency devaluations and stubborn inflation which could worsen due to policy protectionism . Q3 earnings are pointing to sub 10% profit and topline growth, with SMID stocks more impacted given their strong correlation with domestic economic growth. Significant policy stimulus and easing measures are needed in this scenario to lift growth and earnings, but these are lacking so far. In that scenario we see further downsides rather than a recovery in Indian stocks and FPI flows.","[]","Ajay_Bagga","Ajay Bagga","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1498354481767251968/69PPGlrH_normal.jpg","null","null","null",291,17,20,3,14,24825,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Ajay_Bagga/status/1892047432139366578"

Canada has got an ex Goldman Sachs, and ex Bank of England and Bank of Canada Governor as its newly minted Prime Minister . \nSteel and Aluminium tariffs of 25% come due on March 12th in the US, South Korean steel majors are falling sharply as no relief is yet on the horizon.\n Add on China facing deflation, not only in the struggling and oversupplied Producer Prices, but even in the ""cant spend,wont spend, shant make me spend"" Chinese consumption basket.\n Second order impacts of the tariffs, in terms of worsening business outllooks and consumer sentiments, threat of inflation, threat to economic growth and the geopolitical risk of a NATO retreat by the US, are now becoming visible, but in unexpected ways like a weakening US dollar and a falling US market.\n What will China do on the ground is the most pertinent question. \nWill it depreciate the Yuan as it did in 2018-19 , leading to a stock market crash, or will it play a long game, choosing its fights and its fighting fronts ?\n\n Trump faces a government funding shutdown on the 14th , where the Democrats are not ready to play ball on the September temporary funding plan put forth by the House Speaker Johnson .\n That will lead to more uncertainty, with complacent markets saying, ""They posture and then kick the can down the road, dont worry"" .\n What if the Democrats say this is enough, we will not play ball? No one has taken that into the equation so far.\n US CPI and PPI numbers this week will be watched for signs of consumer distress as well as rising prices .\n Indian markets are in a shadow of this global polycrises in the making, and we cant expect a sustainable bottom formation,till there is a semblance of order restored in global economic relations and geopolitics.\n Time to stay cautious and invest fresh funds in a slow format to allow the markets time to discount the Trump Multifront Disruptions .","[]","Ajay_Bagga","Ajay Bagga","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1498354481767251968/69PPGlrH_normal.jpg","null","null","null",200,18,19,1,14,33102,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Ajay_Bagga/status/1899021038601785539"
