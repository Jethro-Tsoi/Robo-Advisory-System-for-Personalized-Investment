"1672503156671127552","2023-06-24 15:13:20 +08:00","Who faces the disruption risk? Existing Players or New Players.. Lets see\n\nWhenever a new trend gets started multiple entrants get attracted, but only few make it to the end when there is consolidation later. This doesn’t mean the newbies don’t have a chance to thrive and evolve. This is an incorrect perception to possess, which can lead to wrong fallacy. As in case of EV, recently Tesla and Foxcon have started proceedings to enter the EV market in India. This will only expand the market and encourage more people towards mass adaptation of EV.\n\n Recently MG launched Comet EV, and created a new market for EV micro cars which didn’t exist earlier. Going forward more companies will enter this space, and there will be market available for everyone to capture with costs coming down. (Read how micro cars became a success in China) Contrary to the opinion where many feels the market gets shrinked when a big player enters a sunrise space, its actually happens the reverse way where the market expands and the adaptation increases. All boils down to the value for money and differentiating factors that the brand offers. It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog. We have seen many market leaders perish to extinction as they were unable to evolve with time (Nokia, Kodak, General Motors).So if at all anyone faces the risk of extinction more its the one that is unwilling to adapt. The new incumbents are the ones wihtout any baggage and they have nothing to lose. They are the ones that generally disrupt and the existing leaders are the ones that get disrupted as they have everything to lose.\n\nWe are at the cusp of biggest automobile revolution since beginning and the least we must do is dismiss it saying EV don't have a chance. Of course there will be stiff competition but winners will also emerge. \n\nAncillaries are a good way to play the EV Megatrend. But In case of ancillaries, the threat of disruption is more prone towards those catering to engine and components in ICE space as we move towards EV. Engines and transmission components , Clutch, Radiators are facing high disruption risk compared to those with supplying suspension, breaks, lighting etc. When disruption happens in a stagnant market its the legacy players that lose market share fast. \n\nThe 3 hurdles for EV adoption are  Range Anxiety, High Upfront Cost(Battery Cost) and Resale Value. As and when we shift towards mass adoption of EVs these problems would gradually dissolve through continues R&D process.\n\nWhen initially 'Hyundai Santro' was launched it was labelled as a tall boy car, gradually people accepted it and Maruti launched 'Wagon R' on similar lines which became a massive hit. There are few products that are launched ahead of their time, but once they click there is no looking back. Remember Dil Chahta Hai movie, which was way ahead of its time when released in 2001 and Andaz Apna Apna in 1994, post their release they achieved a cult status. In my opinion EV will see a similar fate.\n\nWe can also take example of SME investing. Many big funds have started to notice SME cos in micro caps space, this is a positive sign for the whole ecosystem. Their entry will only be beneficial to the existing SME shareholders. \n\nThe summary is new players entering into a lucrative space will expand the market and benefit the consumers. It is about Survival Of The Fittest. The fittest are those endowed with the qualifications for adaptation, the ability to accept the inevitable and conform to the unavoidable, to harmonize with existing or changing conditions.\n\nSo the answer to our question who faces the disruption risk most would be the one that is unwilling to adapt. \n\n “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change.” — Charles Darwin.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/2QeD0B8Ax0"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FzXswYJaMAAx39V?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FzXswYJaMAAx39V?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","GunavanthVaid","Gunavanth Vaid","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1886095602443763712/Ejxen5zQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",356,59,56,4,38,83233,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GunavanthVaid/status/1672503156671127552"

Post listing management bandwidth gets sorted out mostly as the companies that were partnership entities evolve their structure to limited company and hire professionals. \n\nThe financial assistance is now being addressed by TReDS. \n\nThe Trade Receivables Discounting System or TReDS (Trade Receivables Discounting System) is an online platform that allows MSME suppliers to discount their bills and invoices. The RBI launched the Trade Receivables Discounting System in 2018. The platform enables MSMEs to receive payments more quickly. The TReDS’ main purpose is to allow MSME sellers to discount invoices raised against major corporations, which helps them manage their working capital demands.\n\nThis is a very essential change in eco system that will help MSME’s to address their working capital crunch. Going forward this platform should continue to serve many MSMe's and help them in their growth journey..\n\nEcosystem for MSME today and few years back is completely different.

Investors should have the visual perception to envisage the growth curve that lies ahead and the ability to anticipate the opportunity size.\n\n Market Cap potential shouldnt be seen wrt current Order Book and next years profitability.

Indian manufacturing tailwind has picked up significantly. GST collections have been very strong and GDP growing more than 7%. Investors were at discomfort 2 yrs back and even now they are not comfortable with valuations. \n\nI am observing So many small and microcap companies are attempting to do something which they have never done before. From planning for Unprecedented Capex to winning orders more than their annual sales they are trying to do things in much shorter time than it normally takes.  Competing with international players and manufacturing products in India at par, both in terms of quality and price.. (Recent Chandrayan project was classic example)\n\nRecently one of our portfolio company (unlisted), which was L2 in a Govt contract was just behind an international player (L1). The Indian player wrote to the Govt Authority,  we will match the L1 price.. Within a week, without any discussion the concerned Govt authority gave the contract to the domestic player.  This shows the seriousness towards Make In India initiative. \n\nWhen small companies are exposed to such a huge opportunity, there may be some falter here and there, with lots of small cap promoter finding it difficult to navigate through this tailwind due to lack of Bandwidth and Working Capital, as they continue to solve both these issues gradually. In next 2 years we need to be responsible investor with large heart to forgive this transitional issue and think beyond the factors which will see these companies being in Top Gear for a considerable time period.\n\nAs Investor we often link our mind to recent past which is known as anchor ship bias. In last 5 years the small caps have gone through multiple corrections due to various reasons, and those corrections were very important because they laid the foundation for multi year bull run. That doesn’t mean the quantum of correction that happened in last 3 to 4 years will keep happening every six months, but yes we can see intermediate healthy corrections every now and then. \n\n As I said earlier also Promoters are Super bullish and Investors are sceptical which is the perfect combo for a bull market to thrive as the bull feeds from Scepticism and the Bear feeds from Optimism.. Let the dice roll, we will see a long haul bull market in India this decade. \n\nFor a better India, we need to give our entrepreneurs some time to make themselves ready for the big stage ( make them ready to become global players )...We need to be patient Investors. \n\nMany People get uncomfortable when market rises. Only few people are entitled to create wealth peacefully over decades.

Don’t know who is right, but my bet is on second type of promoters. \n\nThis time all companies have done their homework very well. They come well prepared with investor presentations & Pre IPO calls, by hiring  professionals. The word “MOAT” has become so common that every company is using it very conveniently. As an investor, we need to work hard to understand which are the genuine opportunities amongst these and ask ourselves the questions are these companies actually worth investing. So never shy away from hard work, visit the companies, do ground work and scuttlebutt, to find your own rationale. \n\nSimilarly, a new crop of X Investors have entered the market who identify many good companies for investment, but get washed away on 1st signs of corrections. Always remember identifying good company is only a fraction of a job, true test of patience and conviction is in riding it through thick and thin times.

If stock does well the promoter is the hero and if doesn't he is the villain. One needs to understand why they went wrong by listening to them. During a muted earnings phase good companies focus more on strengthening their Research and Development or spent more on process innovation which helps them during good times.\n\n These things won't reflect in the market cap rise often in the near term but work wonders over a longer period. Hence as an investor one needs to exercise some caution before labelling a promoter as bad just because the stock price didn't perform as per their lofty expectations.\n\n A Promoter exploiting minority shareholders and siphoning funds from company is not same as promoter going though a rough patch in business lifecycle. One has to understand the circumstances and intentions behind and not judge simply on the basis of price movement.\n\nEveryone knows Manufacturing was on tailspin last decade. You pick any companies in this space all would have underperformed. Even the best moated companies need a catalyst to perform well. In last 1 year we invested in four companies where the promoters were labelled as not so good based on last decade performance. \n\nWe were lucky enough to not skip them just by hearing to consensus views. We decided to understand the challenges that these businesses faced over the last decade and did our own ground work which worked out phenomenally well for us. \n\nYou cannot get all answers in Social Media.

Keep yourself focussed with calm mind, have a pure heart free from pride and prejudices. Respect your elders, love the young, support the weak and motivate the strong. \n\nRespect is a form of currency that can open many doors and create meaningful relationships. Money can give you temporary security and provide material comforts, but respect will last a lifetime and be more valuable in the long run. Never trade your respect for money. \n\nIf you go to earn only money there is no guarantee you will earn respect, but the day you start getting  respect for Honesty & Integrity, money will definitely follow you, much beyond what you expected & deserved. \n\nEg.

This resulted in rewarding us international players like Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh etc. These players evolved over a period of time and added several skills to their armour. There may be many players who didn’t do well and disappeared but IPL as a platform kept on flourishing over the years. If today Team India is able to field two teams and compete, IPL & Domestic Cricket have to be credited for the same. \n\nMumbai Indians had signed Hardik Pandya for just INR 10 lakh in 2015, and now they have regained him back again for INR 15 crore after 8 years. Similarly they bought Jasprit Bumrah for INR 1.2 crore in 2014, currently the best bowler in world.  Scouting talent is a work of art, never underestimate, never ignore/write off anyone. Someone somewhere did identify the raw talent in them.\n\nSimilarly, SME as a platform provides a large podium,  to all companies to show their performance. Some may emerge as champions, and few would cease to exist in future. There would be many junk companies also but the ability as an Investor, to identify the skilled ones lies upon us.  Our objective must be to pick competent players and invest in them at an early stage. Don’t write off the entire platform without even doing your basic homework. If India GDP goes to 💰 $10 Trillion from $3Trillion, it cannot happen, without participation from MSME sector.\n\nAlso a word of caution- I see lot of poor quality SME companies wanting to list via IPO.  Request all to save your hardearned money. SME in general will out perform the general index. But as investors we need to raise the bar and set high standard of DD & CG..\n\nFOMO at the peak.

One thing that was common in all these companies: was even though they were from non-metro (tier 2-3 cities), still they talked about tapping the global opportunities for their companies. They have big aspirations to tap into export markets.\n\nSome of the key takeaways ..\n\n1) Good business need not necessarily create wealth. A company that is World No-2 in its sector, with a consistent 44-47% gross margin went to the verge of bankruptcy, just because a few decisions backfired. Amazing to see the zeal of promoters to pull it back from the verge of bankruptcy. ( my sense says they will come out of the trouble).\n\n2) An awe-inspiring journey of a  metric pass son of a small-time farmer's journey from a lorry driver to a chairman of a large conglomerate with an interest in metals. Amazing to hear from him when he talks of carbon credit- Elon Mask, Kyoto Protocol, Rare metal, ( Surprised when I came to know he was just a metric pass). Was equally surprised when I met their gen next,  (who studied abroad in reputed colleges) showing equal zeal to take this conglomerate to new heights.\n\n3) Felt proud and joyful, when a chemical engineer along with his son ( equally educated and talented) working mostly in the social impact areas could attract global funds to invest in their company while residing in Tier 3 cities. \n\nI feel blessed to meet such promoters who are courageous & dare to dream big by staying in remote places.

But they are fast losing their edge on cost side, so they need a partner whom they can trust and share the technical knowhow.

This is where the opportunity arises for Indian companies to form a JV/strategic ties up with European company. \n\n-We can provide them good arbitrage in labour and a huge population/TAM size. And for European companies, they can retain their competitiveness by shifting their manufacturing base to India which can be mutually beneficial for both.

As every sector goes through a bad cycle and as an investor, we just need to be on the right side of the trend.

Since the technology is at a nascent stage, 1st movers in a hurry commit too many mistakes. Subsequent players learn from the mistakes of 1st movers and implement a better product.

India has 13 major ports (7 on the eastern coast and 6 on the western coast) and 200 non major ports. Out of the 200 non major ports, 44 are functional and strategically located on the world's shipping routes.  What was missing is bigger Trans-Shipment Ports to handle the large ships and shipments.\n\nTrans Shipment ports are like a transit hub for cargo ships. It is used by ships to transfer cargo from smaller ships to mother ships,  on its way to the final offloading point there by saving significant time & costs. These ports are very critical as all the ports in the world are not directly connected and these ports can act as a key medium to connect India with the rest of the World.\n\nAs per the Maritime India Vision-2030 published by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, the global downturn in the shipbuilding industry significantly impacted the Indian shipyards and India’s share in the Global markets had declined to less than 1%.To solve this problem the Government intends to develop World Class Mega Ports Trans Shipment Hubs and modernized infrastructure at an estimated investment of INR 1.25 Lakh crore, which will also give a huge boost to Indian Manufacturing Growth.\n\nThis will result in lower logistics costs(7-12% savings) for Indian shipping cos/manufacturers and allow them to operate with full freedom and autonomy. Most importantly Indian Shipping companies will become Internationally competitive and will be  able to take a large pie of global shipping industry. \n\nThe southern hemisphere of India very soon will be a key enabler for shipping Industry growth in the global shipping Map.

But when you are running a 42 km marathon there comes a phase in between where you are completely lonely and devoid of any cheers and whistles. People doubt whether you can complete the marathon or not. They doubt your conviction and thesis. The temperament and mental strength you show in this lonely phase will decide whether you complete the marathon successfully or not. #investingbehaviour\n\nSocial Media today is full of noises.

"1810688013217022353","2024-07-09 22:50:37 +08:00","Many people are asking me about the current market conditions. Whether it's undervalued or overvalued?\n\nI don't have any answer to this question, as a lot depends on your time horizon of investments, but the below are my understanding and experiences that I thought should be penned down ✍🏻\n\nIf today RJ(The Eternal Bull) was alive he would have been delighted to see Sensex crossing 80k and moving towards the 6 digits mark. It's a moment of celebration and not misery as this had to happen one day. So cheer up.🥂\n\nYour sample size reflects your personality. \n\nEven while doing a sampling a person can carefully select the samples as per his desired outcome..\n\nLet's prove it..\n\nYou visit any business meet. Do you think people there will talk anything other than business.  \n\nWhen markets are good it's natural for businessmen/Investors to talk more openly about stocks.\n\nA business man discussing his business is considered progressive but an Investor discussing stocks is considered Taboo (A barometer for correction).\n\n I was surprised with the below scuttlebutt:-\n\nI went to my school friends alumni meet. Hardly anyone talked about equity.\n\nI recently went to my cousins marriage at Coonoor. Nobody talked about equity.\n\nGround Data and Scuttlebutt suggests we are still far behind in stock market penetration compared to developed countries. We need to catch up big time. So next time when you see some people pointing to you that many people are talking abt Equity, then be happy and cheerful not sad and disheartened.\n\nInvesting is the fundamental right of every citizen in the country. Gone are the days when it was being treated as previlaged.\n\nInvesting is not divided by caste, creed, religion or financial status.\n\nSensex at 6 digits had to happened one day and it cements the fact that we are developing and climbing up the ladder. Let's celebrate the journey of our index instead of taking the pressure for performing in future.\n\nLike India won the T20 World Cup last month we all celebrated without worrying about the outcome of next Worldcup. Keep focussing on your process, keep improving and results would follow. When you are a batsman your focus must be on the bowlers hand his movement and not the scoreboard. \n\nDon't Convert your Success to Sorrows.\n\nThis is a long journey,  markets will Crack one day only to bounce back more vigorously..\n\nYou should be God to predict that ""one day""\n\nSo whether market is overvalued or not depends upon the horizon you are invested. 10 days, 100 days or 5000 days. Sensex at 80k definitely there pockets of overvaluation but as an investor our objective is always to find pockets of value and growth. For that one needs to work hard and focus more on his internal processes by ignoring external noises. \n\nDesh Badal raha 🇮🇳\nAap apna Soch Badliye🙂\n\nHappy Investing🤝🙏🏻","[]","GunavanthVaid","Gunavanth Vaid","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1886095602443763712/Ejxen5zQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1339,210,197,17,137,150199,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GunavanthVaid/status/1810688013217022353"

"1824443559740616887","2024-08-16 21:50:15 +08:00","Some Weekend Thoughts\n\nOften we get carried away by Data, Numbers & Statistics In the quest to get into too much certainty,  we usually fail to capture the impact of human aspects...emotions, feelings, etc. In most of the young MSME companies, we fail to factor in the Vision &  Ambitions of the promoter. \n\nStatistics are mere numbers devoid of any emotions. Unless you can analyze and interpret, they have little to offer. Investing is surely beyond numbers. It's our ability to visualize where  company’s trajectory is shaping a few years down the line which will determine the outcome. By using Data, which is available and accessible to everyone, we can create a strategy, but these are all mechanical touches. The X factor comes from Human Touches which are impossible to measure & predict.  (How do you quantify & measure - Patience,  Mindset, Vision, Courage, Emotions, Perseverance, Dedication, Temperament & Wisdom).\n\n Let's dive into the past. \n\nRobert Mc Namara was hired by Henry Ford II to help turn around Ford Motors, during World War II, which he did successfully. Later he was asked to lead the Department of Defense at the Pentagon,  during the Vietnam War, where he used the same logic as he used at Ford. He was a hard-core statistical guy and demanded everything to be quantified with daily, weekly & monthly charts. This strategy had a major flaw when used at the Pentagon. It ignored the feelings of Vietnamese people. There was a central issue with managing the  Vietnam War. Americans were killing Vietnamese at a ratio of 10:1. The American people didn’t care about the life of 10 Vietnamese but they certainly cared about that 1 American life. \n\nHo Chi Minh, Former President of North Vietnam, bluntly stated “You will kill ten of us, and we will kill one of you, but it is you who will tire first”.  It's hard to contextualize that on a chart.\n\nWe are a young country, aspiring to become a large & impactful community.  What we ignored was the human aspects of the first-generation promoters and relied too much on data & statistics, hence lot of us missed the unprecedented boom in the market. My sense is going ahead; this will only move further upwards in the trajectory.  It's not too late even today.\n\nWhen we have nothing to lose and have all the zest to take on the challenges/ hurdles, then we increase the probability to emerge as a winner. Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.  \n\nOften I get to hear from my friends how we are lagging far behind in comparison to the western and developed countries. My answer to them is "" This is exactly the opportunity we have in our hands"". We have lot many milestones to achieve & lot more to catch up on. And that's where this great country is giving each of us an opportunity to contribute.\n \nAs we celebrate our 78th Independence Day, I am sure each of our countrymen have enough firepower to complete the unfinished agenda by being Atma Nirbhar and take this great country to the place where we truly deserve to be and what our fore fathers dreamt off....an unfinished dream of being again a ""सोने की चिड़िया""\n\nLet us surprise everyone by accomplishing the agenda of making India a Numero one country to live in. The path is tough, it's not a easy journey but at the same time not an unfeasible proposition.  \n\nLet's make the legendary big bull RJ proud and happy in making his vision of India & the Market come true.\n\nHappy Investing🙏🏻","[]","GunavanthVaid","Gunavanth Vaid","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1886095602443763712/Ejxen5zQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",464,71,86,4,43,44131,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GunavanthVaid/status/1824443559740616887"

Nowadays the  time taken to reach a billion-dollar market cap has shortened compared to the last decade. The major reasons that have fueled this hypergrowth phase are rapid Digitization and Disruption, along with Demographic Diversity.\n \nJust take the example of how NSE’s transactions have seen a multi-fold growth post-adoption of new-age technologies. NSE’s cash spend on capital and operational expenses on technology has been approximately INR 900 crores, well supported by a strong technology workforce of approximately 1500+ people. Beyond doubt NSE has been fulfilling its vision of catalyzing India's transition from a banking-based financing model to a capital market-based financing model, bolstered by innovative, market-driven products. \n\nAlso, the example of how Credit Cards as a product have touched the lives of many Indians who were earlier unable to afford aspirational products. The innovation Of UPI where crores of transactions take place in a single day fuelling the economy in a healthy way. Currently, daily UPI transaction in India stands at approx.  44.3 crore transactions a day, and averaging a value of Rs 65933 crore. Daily FASTag transactions stood at 32.8 crore amounting to Rs 5,592 crore. \n\nThis is how technology has been a massive enabler in the growth of our country. (cheapest Internet Cost In World)\n\nJust imagine if banks would not have gone digital, then we would have been running physically  to banks for simple works like Deposits, Withdrawals, and Money Transfers and the queue would have been longer than we see in our temples. \n\nTechnology is changing, Business Cycles have shortened, the aspiration to try something new is increasing amongst the citizens each passing day. \n\nMoats are being challenged, disrupted and defended as well. We live in an era where we are only bounded by our imagination. Think Big, make It large. The size of your success is determined by the size of your belief. You cannot be living life and making estimates based on what happened 10 years back. \n\n Think Outside the Box and play beyond the rules. Take Risks, and Embrace your failures, keep refining yourself.  Short Temper is a weapon of mass destruction whereas Strong Temperament is an act of perseverance. Perpetual Optimism is a force multiplier.\n\nThanks 🙏🏻","[]","GunavanthVaid","Gunavanth Vaid","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1886095602443763712/Ejxen5zQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",464,53,82,0,39,39020,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GunavanthVaid/status/1824876389075460254"

Many young companies are getting huge opportunities due to several factors, most importantly China plus 1, Ukraine war,  European crisis etc.\n\nA meaningful part of this opportunity has been rightly captured by Indian MSMEs. They have done some amazing stuff.  A lot of young professionals who in my view would have flown to the US or some other country , have stayed back and instead started their entrepreneurial journey in india. And here the SME platform has played an important role in giving them the much needed equity ( growth plus risk capital). A good number of these SME companies have done a wonderful job in nation building in the last few years. Most of these 1st gen Entrepreneurs have big aspirations in their heart but limited funding to back those ideas. Banking is a limited option for them as they don't have much tangible assets for collateral leaving equity dilution as the only hope.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying MSME will play a big role in our dream to become a 10 trillion dollar economy.  China is a classic recent example which demonstrated that young companies with the right mix of equity and talent can do wonders and go on to become large conglomerates. Today SME is at Infection Point. \n\nOur young entrepreneurs are not inferior to them in terms of capabilities.  Let us  believe them once, let us give some time, I am sure they will deliver. \n\nAnd yes there will be bad elements creeping in and misusing this euphoria but  we can't close a highway just because few accidents may happen. Let us lower our greed and believe once into these young entrepreneurs. \n\nThis great nation needs hundreds of Ambani & Adani and I am sure few among the current Msme too will join them.\n\nSME needs a VC type mindset. Along with Sme entrepreneurs my salute to all Sme investors who have the guts to bet on the vision of promoters and stay with them in good times and tough times. \n\nThanks to @LuckyInvest_ARK from the bottom of my heart 🙏🏻\n\nA lot of marquee Investors whom I respect but don't want to name publicly have invested in SMEs and have supported many hardworking entrepreneurs. In the truest sense we have become Atmanirbhar, since Retail is participating in nation building and MSME progress and we are not much reliant on FII money. Also thanks to the Government for providing a great platform for MSME to show what they are capable of.\n\nDiscl. Today 90% of my PF is from MSME and unlisted space.

"1835509310681412034","2024-09-16 10:41:36 +08:00","To counter the Chinese intervention in Surveillance Cameras, The government has amended the compulsory registration order for CCTV cameras sold in India to make testing of their 'essential security parameters' mandatory.\n\nSecuring a CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) system is crucial to protect sensitive information and ensure \rthe system operates effectively. Key areas of testing include exposed network services, device communication \rprotocols, physical access to the device’s UART, JTAG, SWD, etc., the ability to extract memory and firmware, \rfirmware update process security and storage and encryption of data.\n\nThe Union Government has come out with safety guidelines keeping national security as top priority.\n\nTill date, the Indian Government had no mechanism to check the installation of these Chinese-origin surveillance cameras, as the certification for such devices in use in the country only looked into aspects such as fire hazard or durability, and not security or snooping threats.\n\nChina’s Hikvision controlled India’s surveillance market. US had already invoked the National Defense Authorization Act and prohibited government agencies from purchasing video surveillance products from Hikvision.\n\nHikvision is one of the world’s largest video surveillance companies producing both hardware and software tools.Hikvision exists in India under the name Prama Hikvision Indian Private Limited. As per reports, Hikvision enjoys over 35 per cent market share in India\n\nIt is also listed as a vendor by Bharat Electronics (BEL), which works on highly sensitive and classified defence projects for the government of India. More worryingly, Hikvision has allegedly also supplied solutions to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), and the Special Protection Group (SPG), which is responsible for the security of the prime minister.\n\nThis leaves India with a tricky situation. Admittedly such companies do create secondary economic benefits for India with the local assembly and selling units creating jobs at home. However, there is arguably a bigger price India  pays in terms of handing its CCTV grid to a country that  is a threat to our national security.\n\nHowever recently the Govt felt it's high time We need to reclaim our physical territory along with our digital spaces. \n\nSo Govt of India banned 17 Chinese companies from participating in tenders in India and also warned private companies that do business with Govt entities against using these Chinese products.\n\nBanned companies include Highvision,\n Hikvision, Lenovo, Dahua, Lava, Xolo, Airpro, Nokia etc.\n\nThis will not only prevent Chinese companies from snooping into Indian National security but also give a massive thrust to domestic manufacturers to reclaim the market share that used to be dominated by the Chinese.\n\nAbove was just an example, this pattern is being repeated across many sectors where capability to produce in India is already present and Sovereignty of INDIA is under threat. We have the right to govern ourselves without any external interference.","[]","GunavanthVaid","Gunavanth Vaid","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1886095602443763712/Ejxen5zQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",484,69,106,8,44,158332,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GunavanthVaid/status/1835509310681412034"

Sale of BIS Mandatory Products within the country requires adherence to applicable Indian standards and the inclusion of the standard mark. Failure to meet these criteria results in the prohibition of selling such products within India. So basically, the Government is expanding the items under BIS making the registration compulsory there by indirectly stopping the imports from other countries. As per the QCO, after a particular date no large-scale/small scale manufacturer along with foreign manufacturer can sell in India without license, and also they won’t get custom clearance. \n\nRecently BIS registration was introduced for domestic stainless steel vacuum flask bottle, Insulated Container for Food Storage, which was published on 13th June, 2024 in the official gazette.\n\nSimilarly, following products also have been introduced to have BIS certification:-\n\n-BIS ISI Mark  for Kitchen Electrical Appliances \n-BIS-ISI Mark Certification for Polypropelene Materials for Moulding and Extrusion\n-BIS Certification for Cast Iron Products\n-BIS Certification for Fire Extinguishers\n-BIS Certification for Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) Homopolymers\n-BIS Certification for Morpholine\n-BIS Certification for Water Meters and Accessories\nAnd many others...\n\nAs an Investor we have to remain updated with the various guidelines being introduced by the central govt to boost local manufacturing. The domestic market is being opened up in massive way for all MSMEs who have manufacturing facilities along with testing facilities.

The past is gone, but the next big opportunity is still ahead!""*\n\nDuring a market correction, one of the biggest psychological challenges investors face is accepting the decline in their portfolio’s value. The mind struggles to adjust to the new level, leading to regret over not selling at the peak and a constant cycle of lamentation. This emotional turmoil often brings to mind the song ""Ae waqt ruk ja, tham ja, thehar ja, wapas jara, laut piche...""—a reflection of the desire to turn back time.\n\nHowever, instead of dwelling on past losses, investors should take the following steps:\n\n• Accept the new reality – The most important step is to wholeheartedly accept the current portfolio value as determined by the market. Acceptance reduces stress and allows for clearer decision-making.\n\n• Assess and optimize the portfolio – Use this period to introspect and evaluate your holdings. Identify strong performers and allocate more capital to the best ideas, while reconsidering investments in underperforming companies/management. \n\n• Learn from past mistakes – Reflect on the errors made in the previous bull market to avoid repeating them in the future.\n\n• Develop a positive mindset and stay proactive – A market correction presents new opportunities. Many potential multi-baggers are still available. The key is to identify and invest in them with a fresh perspective.\n\n• Focus on the bigger picture – In times of distress, we often overlook the positive developments happening in our country. There are numerous exciting investment themes and ""Make in India"" opportunities unfolding. History has shown that we have always come back stronger, and this time will be no different.\n\nThere may be people who can claim they are correct for short term (Maine Bola Tha). But when you are investing for long term there is hardly any incentive to sell and reenter again. Even if you give me a second chance and say market will fall sell everything, my decision would still be to hold all  stocks where I have conviction and not time it by selling to buyback lower.\n\n For being right in long term you have to appear wrong in short term.\n\nHappy Investing","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/OWNlxaVHtp"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GjhwINLXoAAkLBB?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GjhwINLXoAAkLBB?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","GunavanthVaid","Gunavanth Vaid","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1886095602443763712/Ejxen5zQ_normal.jpg","null","null","null",445,90,107,0,21,33943,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/GunavanthVaid/status/1889383333299363958"
