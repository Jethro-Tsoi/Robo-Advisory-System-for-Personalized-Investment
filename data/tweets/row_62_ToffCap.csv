That'll be >20% yoy growth and roughly reflective of the yoy backlog growth as well as the higher throughput from automation.\n\nADF has also been very clear to assume 'normalized' gross margins of 24/25%, lower vs the last (abnormal) quarter but still a very decent level.\n\nBut importantly, reported Q1 ebitda included a -$5.5m impact from the m2m effect of the company’s stock compensation, which ADF for some reason assumes as operational.\n\nThis charge will not be repeated in Q2, which is a pretty big 'correction' to ebitda.\n\nAll in all, >$20m ebitda would be a very good result. As a reminder, $20m would imply +60% yoy.\n\nWe regularly highlighted $DRX on the blog, as well as lots of interesting event-driven trades and investments.

My experience has been that it generally pays to just wait until the tailwinds start to become clearly visible in the fundamentals.\n\nYou might miss the bounce from the lows, though once the uptrend starts it tends to go a long way in these industries as tailwinds tend to be multi-year.\n\nTrading at ~7x FY24e ev/ebitda is not aggressive though not extremely cheap either. \n\nBut IF the market turns, $CTOS will be well positioned and earnings growth and cash flow generation will do their thing on the equity.\n\n$CTOS could have an interesting time ahead, and I'll be keeping an eye on it.\n\nWe highlighted $CTOS on our Toffcap Monday Monitor, our overview of interesting event-driven trades and companies.

Yoy revenue decline in Q2, as a large client is facing some delays, and so ADF.\n\nWhile not nice that it happens, this is the nature of the business. Big infrastructure projects are lumpy, and 💩 happens.\n\nThese revenues are postponed, possibly for a few quarters, though not 'gone'. Q2 would have otherwise been another impressive quarter from a revenue perspective ($100m+).\n\n2. ADF mentioned a slowdown in certain end-market segments due to uncertainty given the US elections. These projects relate to 'green' infrastructure projects. \n\nWhile some may take this as a sign that we've reached peak cycle, I've often discussed how we're not even close to peak.\n\nEnd-market demand remains very healthy and has been mainly due to onshoring dynamics. Demand from the big infrastructure packages have still to hit the top line.\n\nThe company reiterated to see growth over the next 2-3 years. And while the backlog is down to $400m, it's still at very healthy levels. Remember, this is a very lumpy market, and projects swing around.\n\nAll in all, at the current share price ADF $DRX is trading at <3x ev/ebitda on annualised H1 performance.\n\nEven if the cycle would end tomorrow - which it won't - I would argue this is an extremely punitive level.","[]","ToffCap","ToffCap","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1586769567417864192/1nK8UJzy_normal.jpg","null","null","1834192384634048880",28,1,9,2,3,19583,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/ToffCap/status/1834255426499526993"

Infrastructure cycles generally last >decade.\n\nAt 3x ev/ebit on H1 annualised (excl. H2 cash) the market is assuming all this will revert, and some more.\n\nIn short, I believe that many underestimated the lumpiness of this industry, particularly compared to the size of ADF, and are letting price drive the narrative.\n\nThe fundamentals will naturally turn at some point and business will slow. Though I have not been given an indication based on H1 results that we are anywhere near this moment.\n\nBut enough about it (for now).

"1836378356708765760","2024-09-18 20:14:53 +08:00","Rehashing 10 great quotes from 🐐 Stanley Druckenmiller as food for thought 👇\n\n1.  I never use valuation to time the market. I use liquidity considerations and technical analysis for timing. Valuation only tells me how far the market can go once a catalyst enters the picture to change the market direction.\n\n2.  The first thing I heard when I got in the business, not from my mentor, was bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered. I’m here to tell you I was a pig. And I strongly believe the only way to make long-term returns in our business that are superior is by being a pig.\n\n3.  Earnings don’t move the overall market; it’s the Federal Reserve Board… focus on the central banks and focus on the movement of liquidity. Most people in the market are looking for earnings and conventional measures. It’s liquidity that moves markets.\n\n4.  When you’re trading well, you have a better mental attitude. When you’re trading poorly, you start wishing and hoping. Instead of the market talking to you, you’re talking to yourself.\n\n5.  I believe that good investors are successful not because of their IQ, but because they have an investing discipline.\n\n6. In this business, if you’re good, you’re right six times out of ten. You’re never going to be right nine times out of ten.\n\n7. My strength is economic forecasting, but that only works in free markets, when markets are smarter than people. That’s how I started. I watched the stock market, how equities reacted to change, or economic data. That’s where I get the confidence in my views.\n\n8. Many managers have no idea what their edge is.

"1852731811220042178","2024-11-02 23:17:40 +08:00","After c. +70% since my first posting about a year ago, InPost's $INPST potential remains vastly underestimated.\n\nDespite the strong run, I believe there's still multi-bagger potential left here and that the story will continue to accelerate going forward.\n\nThere aren't many growth companies out there operating in simple, legacy markets which are still largely ignored. Even by competitors!\n\nAs a reminder, InPost is a Polish operator of Automated Parcel Machine lockers (APMs), listed in Amsterdam. It's a rather unique and high-growing company.  \n\nInPost continues to perform well and take market share from legacy postal players, who tend to be sleepy and slow.\n\nThe current operational set-up consists of three core markets: Poland, France and the UK.\n\n$INPST is already dominating the Polish market, where it was able to ‘convert’ the consumer to APM delivery from the legacy to-door delivery.\n\nInPost has roughly 25k APMs in Poland and management is confident that >50k APMs can be deployed. Btw, this 'target' number only continues to increase.\n\nAlready achieved critical mass, Poland is rapidly becoming a big cash cow. I believe that in <5yrs time the Polish operations alone could be worth the current market cap.\n\nMost growth will come from InPost's International markets, France (Mondial Relay), the UK and Italy + Spain.\n\nFrance is an attractive market, where ~30% of parcel deliveries are already out-of-home. InPost acquired Mondial Relay, which overall consisted of PUDO (pick-up, drop-off) points.\n\nMR's service was relatively low quality, but cheap. The company is now rapidly improving the service (e.g. expanding the infrastructure, introducing t+1/2 delivery, etc) and replacing PUDO points with APMs, which are much cheaper to operate and offer higher utilization rates (hence much higher ROICs).\n\nThe next few years are still investment mode (i.c. depressed margins), but cash flow should steadily ramp.\n\nIndeed, show far in FY24 the company is already back on the margin expansion path.\n\nThe UK is the latest and largest growth avenue, now with uncapped capacity given the acquisition of Menzies Distribution.   \n\nThis is a BIG market given high volumes, particularly return volumes, which is a perfect fit for the APM proposition.\n\nThe UK already reached ebitda break-even and will continue to grow at hyperspeed. I believe that the UK alone could make up 50% of today's ebitda in a few years.\n\nJust imagine, $INPST is targeting over 500m volumes (!) over the medium term in the UK.\n\nInPost might not look very cheap at current numbers, but the pathway for growth is very long. The company has true ‘disruptor’ potential and is already aggressively attacking legacy markets.\n\nCompetition is slow or non-existent. Even the ones taking APMs seriously (like PKN Orlen) are >5ys behind, and/or do not have the capital + the best APM spots are already taken.\n\nIn a few years’ time, InPost $INPST will have three large cash flow generating divisions, with each one potentially large enough to reflect the current valuation. \n\nImportantly, the larger the company, the more rapidly it will attack new markets (such as Italy and Spain). \n\nThis is the next step.\n\nBy the time competition catches up (IF they can catch up), InPost will have a pan-European APM network including the necessary infrastructure.\n\nAt Toffcap we look at a lot of interesting companies and event-driven investments - for free.

They have more choices. They demand more. In short, they get more for doing less. That’s not good for overall productivity.\n\nAdd to this that these employees are increasingly the current Insta and TikTok generation. Not good.\n\nSo you see this problem (which many still don’t) and compensate by investing in efficiency, right? \n\nNope. \n\nWell – they think – perhaps the solution is MORE regulation.\n\nI talk to European companies.

I estimate the stock offers 95% upside from here vs. -12% downside, implying a highly asymmetric risk/return profile.\n\nLong-regarded as a high-quality, serial-acquirer/compounder name, DCC’s share price has stalled in recent years as investors lost interest in the stock amid concerns around the prospects for its Energy division and headwinds impacting its smaller Healthcare and Technology businesses. \n\nHowever, recently management surprised the market with the news that it intends to break-up DCC’s long-standing conglomerate structure to focus on its highest-growth, highest return division, DCC Energy. \n\nThe break-up has the potential to unlock significant value for shareholders. \n\nI estimate the divestments of the Healthcare and Technology divisions could raise ~£2.2bn / 41% of DCC’s entire market cap.\n\nThis implies that the remaining DCC Energy business (which accounts for c.75% of DCC’s operating profits) is valued at just 6.8x EBITDA (a near trough multiple for the stock and compares to DCC’s historic average multiple of 11.8x).\n\nThis just seems too low for a c. 19% ROIC, c. 10% earnings growth business with strong FCF generation (~7.5% FCFE yield). \n\nManagement have stated that surplus cash from the break-up will be returned to shareholders, with the RemainCo well positioned for a market re-rating as a simplified energy-growth story, supported by energy security and energy transition tailwinds. \n\n$DCC was highlighted recently in our Toffcap Monday Monitor, our overview of interesting event-driven trades and special sits.

"1873759646328012899","2024-12-30 23:54:47 +08:00","Zedge $ZDGE is an interesting, fairly liquid micro-cap (~$200k daily average turnover) that we highlighted recently on the blog.\n\nZedge provides platforms for personalizing your mobile phone, offering a variety of content like wallpapers, ringtones and sounds that you can use to customize the look and sound of your phone.\n\nNot exactly your high-tech software company, but there’s a market for these things.\n\nZedge had a few strong years thanks to covid tailwinds, where earnings went from basically zero to ~$8m in a year, with the share price skyrocketing 13x. \n\nThe company made a healthy amount of cash, and all was good for a moment. But then came the hangover, and the share price returned to earth.\n\nIn the meantime, like many others in their field, they decided to ‘invest’ their excess cash in diversifying its revenue stream. \n\nThe company bought GuruShots in 2022, an app designed as a photography game that allows users to participate in photo challenges and competitions.\n\nThis GuruShots – for which they paid $35m in cash and stock, $18m upfront and the rest in earnouts – has been a complete dog.\n\nJust one year after the acquisition Zedge had to impair the thing as growth never took off. \n\nIn FY24, 88% of our revenues were still generated from its legacy Zedge Marketplace business (o/w the majority is selling advertising inventory).\n\nSo what is there to like about Zedge? Quite a bit actually.\n\nDespite GuruShots being a total loser, the company’s topline has continued to grow, from roughly $10m in FY20 to $30m in FY24 (FY ending July), most of it stemming from the company’s legacy business. \n\nThat is not a bad achievement and indicates resilience.\n\nMore interesting, while gross margins are >90%, operating margins have been extremely pressured by strong increase in sg&a, mostly a result of the integration of GuruShots; the company’s FTE base almost doubled between 2021 (51) and 2023 (94).\n\nSo why is this all interesting?\n\nFirst of all, $ZDGE is taking big steps towards improving its offering, soon also offering tools for those who want to create and share their own digital content, instead of just providing wallpapers and sounds.\n\nBut the story is also interesting because Zedge didn’t restructure after the GuruShots fiasco. They never cut costs.\n\nManagement is still seeing potential to leverage this enhanced cost base. GuruShots remains a work-in-progress – and as such a drag to growth – but Zedge is taking decisive steps to improve its growth trajectory.\n\nWho knows if they’ll be able to turn it around, but the main point is that if this all fails there’s significant fat on the bones here, and Zedge could strongly increase its ebitda just by cutting its FTE base should GuruShots’ growth remain lackluster.\n\nQ1 25 earnings showed slowing advertising growth as a result of some temporary challenges that now have been resolved. Q2 should show a return to growth with the CEO anticipating “significant improvements”.\n\nBottom line, either Zedge turns GuruShots around or it kills it (in theory – if management is smart). Both options are fine.\n\nAdd to this all that Zedge is a profitable and cash flow generating company, with 50% of the market cap in net cash. \n\nThe company is currently trading at 8x ev/ebitda on very depressed FY24 ebitda.

These are businesses with multiple locations or those that handle a high volume of transactions.\n\nLightspeed caught my attention because of a few things.\n\nThe company keeps growing well at impressive rates. Recently, Lightspeed reached a $1bn revenue run rate (this was <$100m in 2019) and the company is confident it will be able to continue to grow strongly.\n\nOperating leverage is doing its thing and it seems that they can (finally) become profitable next year. \n\nThe ytd results bode well, with ~24% revenue growth but roughly stable opex. This is what we want to see.\n\n$LSPD also has a very comfortable net cash position, at almost 30% of the current market cap. They raised cash a few times but are very close to not needing it anymore. \n\nIndeed, Lightspeed switched to buying back shares since the beginning of this year.\n\nAnother interesting dynamic is that the company is working with bankers (JP Morgan) to conduct a strategic review of its business and operations. \n\nThe company mentioned it is engaged in discussions relating to 'a range of potential strategic alternatives'.\n\nLightspeed also recently announced a reorganization, planning to cut 200 jobs, and the shares dropped as the market might think that the strategic review will not result in a sale. \n\nThis could however just be an action to make the company more ‘pretty’.\n\nStill doing the works, but taking Bloomberg consensus for the moment, Lightspeeds is trading at ~20x FY26 ev/ebitda (FY March) for >40% ebitda growth pa over the medium term and a very solid b/s.\n\nThat's not a stretch imo for what should be pretty high (and now cash flow generating) growth for many years.\n\n(and yes I know, SBC is horrible).\n\nWe highlighted $LSPD recently on the blog.

"1875176789863272539","2025-01-03 21:46:00 +08:00","The recent Vivendi $VIV mega-split is providing some interesting opportunities. One of them is good old Havas $HAVAS. \n\nWe’ve known Havas for a long time. The sixth-largest advertising agency globally, it ranks below Publicis, Omnicom, WPP, Interpublic, and Dentsu, making it the smallest among the ‘big 6’.\n\nAs regularly highlighted in our TMM, we expected quite some volatility around the split; all four business are pretty different and have to trade accordingly. \n\nAnd indeed we’ve selling pressure, particularly over the first days.\n\n$HAVAS has long been a ‘meh’ kind of business, with plenty of competition, both in people and end-markets. \n\nThe Bolloré group holds a controlling interest of 31.05%, with the potential for increased voting rights in the future, which could influence strategic decisions.\n\nI can be short and simple on the thesis with Havas as we’re not looking for fireworks here.\n\nThe company should grow revenues in the low single digit% organically over the next few years, increasing their operating profit margin (roughly 12% in FY23) given a bit of operating leverage. \n\nEven with this growth, they'll keep facing some restructuring costs as they adapt. Cash flow is expected to stay strong, with an aim to give back 40% of their net profit to shareholders as dividends.\n\nFor FY25, the company is looking for ~2% revenue growth and a 13% adj. ebit margin (mid-range). Call it €360m. WPP is trading at 8.6x ev/ebit, Publicis at 11.3x. Let’s take 7.5x; that’ll be €2.7bn enterprise value.\n\nNow assuming a FY24e net cash position of €150m, give or take €850m in lease liabilities, pensions, earn-outs and minorities, and €250m in FY25e FCF (some very back-of-the-envelope numbers), we get €2.25bn equity – that’s ~40% higher than today.\n\nThis is not bad for a one-year horizon. \n\nOf course there are higher return opportunities elsewhere, but the main point here is that this should be a very simple, easy to follow story – thus relatively easy for the market to assess once the dust settles.\n\nOne can make good money when there's good visibility, even if the upside is not the moon.\n\nAs a last point: to compare, in the period 2012-2016 (before Vivendi took Havas private), Havas traded in an ev/ebit range of roughly 8.5-11.5x.\n\nWe recently wrote about $HAVAS on the blog.

We’re looking for insider purchases that stand out – very large purchases, new buys after a long time with no action, purchases when the shares hit new highs, etc. \n\nIn simple terms, buys that might indicate that something interesting is happening.\n\nThis seems to be the case at DSW Capital, with some VERY large purchases in the open market recently by the founder / CEO (and largest shareholder) as well as a few other major shareholders. \n\nEvery time I see this happening at a profitable micro-cap, I stop and check it out.\n\nIn short, $DSW is a professional services firm that operates through a network of licensee businesses.\n\nThey do corporate finance advisory, financial due diligence, provide tax services, etc. The main focus is SME m&a activities (67% of H1 24 revenues).\n\nDSW doesn’t offer these services directly. Instead, they license their brand and back-office support to independent businesses (licensees) that perform these services. \n\nThe licensees pay DSW a fee based on their revenue (average fee in the mid-teens%, new licenses around 22%), allowing DSW to earn income without directly handling client projects. \n\nLooking at the recent H1 24 results and the progression over the past few years, the growth does not exactly scream excitement. \n\nThis should not be a surprise given the state of end-markets over the past few years (2022 was a good year in terms of deals, but deal flow over the past few years has been relatively subdued).\n\nWhat makes $DSW interesting is the recent acquisition of DR Solicitors, a law firm specializing in legal services for primary care. \n\nDR was acquired for £6.1m and thus represents a significant acquisition compared to DSW’s size.\n\nDR Solicitors will serve as a new legal services division within DSW and will significantly diversify their portfolio, reducing dependence on m&a activities. \n\nDR is also expected to enhance DSW's earnings; the company generated £3.1m revenues in FY24 and £1.2m ebitda, quite the step up from what DSW generated over the past few years.\n\nThis acquisition drastically changes the earnings profile of the company, creating more stability and bringing the consolidated DSW back on a profitable and cash flow generating growth path. \n\nThis should warrant a higher valuation. And this all excludes DSW’s legacy business returning back to growth at some point – which it will.\n\nLastly, who knows how many of these interesting acquisitions are in the pipeline…\n\nWe highlighted $DSM recently on the blog.

"1880242167257383023","2025-01-17 21:14:00 +08:00","I know, crappy company in a crappy industry.\n\nBut so far the Tecnicas Reunidas $TRE thesis is progressing well, and the share price is tracking along nicely.\n\nWhen I first wrote about $TRE, nobody cared. Now very few care, but the market cap is back over €1bn - for the first time in almost 5 years.\n\nI still believe we are at the early stages of this new cycle.\n\nWe're seeing steady growth and improved quality of the order book, revenues and operating margins.\n\nThis remains one of my investments with the most torque (playing this with long-dated calls).\n\nThe shares are still very far off their potential. There's 2-3x potential over the next few years and 4-5x by FY28 should $TRE be able to continue to perform and hit the guidance.\n\n$TRE is projecting >5% ebit margin and €160m net profit in FY26. For FY28, TR is targeting c. 8% ebit.\n\nDuring the last cycle (2006-2014) TR achieved max ~€150m net income. During the peak years, the company was trading at roughly 15x p/e on average.\n\nAt 15x on the FY26 guidance TR would be +60% from from today.\n\nBut the FY28 guidance of 8% ebit implies >30% income growth pa over the few years after FY26. \n\nWhy can't the multiple be higher in a few years? 15x on let's say €300m would be >4x vs today - excl. the cash generated.\n\nAnd this all assuming earnings stabilize thereafter. If we're indeed in a super cycle, we could see massive growth and cash generation for a decade.\n\nBut there are good reasons why the stock is still far off these levels:\n\n- there's not much love given poor management decisions in the past\n- we're still shell shocked from the recent horrible downcycle\n- EPC firms (like TR) constantly face cost overruns, delays, disputes with clients, as well as geopolitical and regulatory risks\n- Add to that the highly competitive landscape, with numerous global and regional players vying for contracts\n\nBut this is why I love these industries. Sooner or later the cycle turns, and few people are watching.\n\nThere will be a ton of volatility ahead, but so far so good. Let's hope $TRE doesn't mess it up.\n\nWe wrote about Tecnicas Reunidas on the blog roughly a year ago.

They never cut costs.\n\nManagement is still seeing potential to leverage this enhanced cost base. GuruShots remains a work-in-progress – and as such a drag to growth – but Zedge is taking decisive steps to improve its growth trajectory.  \n\nWho knows if they’ll be able to turn it around, but the main point is that if this all fails there’s significant fat on the bones here, and Zedge could strongly increase its ebitda just by cutting its FTE base should GuruShots’ growth remain lackluster.\n\nThis is an important first step. But the main takeaway here is that mgt is clearly willing to cut (more) costs if it won't work out.\n\nThis remains a very interesting case. \n\nImagine, just based on the restructuring benefits, and nothing else, $ZDGE is trading at 9x ev/ebitda with >50% of the market cap in net cash.\n\nAnd that fully excludes any earnings from the rest of the business and the potential benefits of a successful restructuring of GuruShots.\n\nWe highlighted $ZDGE not so long ago on the blog.

Pretty nice growth.\n\nOverall $TITC's results remain solid, mainly thanks to better pricing and efficiency. \n\nThe US side of the business is doing particularly well, which bodes well for the spin. US demand is expected to remain strong given big spending on infrastructure and housing.\n\nBut Greece and Southeast Europe are also looking good, with lots of big projects and EU money coming in.\n\n$TITC is currently also very active on the open market on its buyback.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nWe highlighted $TITC in our Toffcap Monday Monitor, our overview of interesting event-driven trades and companies.

Both are very abused terms. \n\nBut interesting nonetheless, given the impressive valuation pressures on the industry where break-ups are more and more used as efficient tools to unlock value.\n\nAt ~9x ev/ebitda on FY24e we believe there definitely should be value to unlock by reviewing the portfolio.\n\nWe highlighted $NGTV recently on the blog.

Now very few care, but the market cap is back over €1bn - for the first time in almost 5 years.\n\nWe're seeing steady growth and improved quality of the order book, revenues and operating margins.\n\nThis remains one of my investments with the most torque (playing this with long-dated calls).\n\nThe shares are still very far off their potential. There's 2-3x potential over the next few years and 4-5x by FY28 should $TRE be able to continue to perform and hit the guidance.\n\n$TRE is projecting >5% ebit margin and €160m net profit in FY26. For FY28, TR is targeting c. 8% ebit.\n\nDuring the last cycle (2006-2014) TR achieved max ~€150m net income. During the peak years, the company was trading at roughly 15x p/e on average.\n\nAt 15x on the FY26 guidance TR would be +60% from from today.\n\nBut the FY28 guidance of 8% ebit implies >30% income growth pa over the few years after FY26. \n\nWhy can't the multiple be higher in a few years? 15x on let's say €300m would be >4x vs today - excl. the cash generated.\n\nAnd this all assuming earnings stabilize thereafter. If we're indeed in a super cycle, we could see massive growth and cash generation for a decade.\n\nBut there are good reasons why the stock is still far off these levels:\n\n- there's not much love given poor management decisions in the past\n- we're still shell shocked from the recent horrible downcycle\n- EPC firms (like TR) constantly face cost overruns, delays, disputes with clients, as well as geopolitical and regulatory risks\n- Add to that the highly competitive landscape, with numerous global and regional players vying for contracts\n\nBut this is why I love these industries. Sooner or later the cycle turns, and few people are watching.\n\nThere will be a ton of volatility ahead, but so far so good. Let's hope $TRE doesn't mess it up.\n\nWe wrote about Tecnicas Reunidas on the blog roughly a year ago.
