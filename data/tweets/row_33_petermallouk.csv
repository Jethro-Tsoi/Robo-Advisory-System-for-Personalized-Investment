Investor exuberance over the prospects for a richly valued stock can always became more exuberant.\n\nBut over the long run, valuation tends to matter a lot, especially after extremes.\n\nThe latest example: Nike ($NKE), which traded at a record 6x sales just a few years ago. Fast forward to today and it trades at 2x sales, right around the historical average.\n\nIts 58% drawdown is the biggest for the company since 2000.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nGrowth rates and sentiment. Sales have declined over the past year, demand from China has plummeted, and Nike is forecasting further weakness in the quarters to come.\n\nWhen all the news was positive, Nike’s elevated valuation didn’t seem to matter at all.

While there are many reasons for this, from my perspective, 3 rise to the top:\n\n1. It’s been a very long time since our last correction. Far longer than normal. It’s easy to forget that volatility is not the exception.  It’s the norm. A correction is a drop of 10% or more, and an average correction is 14%. These happen every 10-15 months. We haven’t had a correction since October, 2022.  Memories are short, especially with investing. \n\n2. While the percentage drop of a correction isn’t historically big, the ‘points’ the market drops is now very big given where the DOW sits. A normal correction would be a 6,500 point drop. Sounds super scary. Just a few years ago a similar percentage drop in the DOW would be a 3,500 point drop. Focus on percentages, not numbers. \n\n3. The rhetoric and policies coming out of the Trump administration - whether one agrees with them or not - has many people more on edge. There’s a lot more sensitivity around political influence on markets. There  are few things people are more sensitive to than politics and money. Mix them together and you get an emotional firestorm for some.","[]","PeterMallouk","Peter Mallouk","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1385710073524199428/7AkNJdFN_normal.jpg","null","null","null",460,66,141,6,29,77674,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/PeterMallouk/status/1900216100543225873"
