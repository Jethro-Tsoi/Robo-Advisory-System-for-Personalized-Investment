Mike is hanging back a bit in sixth, conserving his energy for later, while Dave, Mark, and Chris are biding their time at the rear of the pack. \n\nAs they approach the first turn, Steve continues to hold the lead, but Adam is not letting him out of his sight. John remains in third, and now we see Greg starting to edge ahead of Paul into fourth. Mike is still lurking in the middle, just waiting for the right moment.

John is making a play for the lead, pulling up alongside Steve! Steve is fighting to maintain his position, but John is relentless, and it looks like he might just edge ahead! Meanwhile, Adam is sticking right with them, not willing to let either of them out of his sight. \n\nBack in the pack, Greg is still holding onto fourth, but now Mike is making a move! Mike is gaining ground rapidly, cutting down the distance between himself and the leaders. Chris isn't far behind, and it looks like Paul is also starting to make his move. Mark and Dave are still at the back, but they're beginning to inch closer, not wanting to be left out of the action. \n\nAs they approach the final turn, it's still Steve and John battling it out at the front, but Adam is right there with them, and now Mike is joining the fray! Greg is trying to hang on, but Chris is charging hard on the outside! Paul is digging deep, trying to stay in contention, while Mark and Dave are finally starting to come alive, making their move from the back of the pack. \n\nHere they come into the home stretch! It's a four-horse race now, with Steve, John, Adam, and Mike all neck and neck! Greg is giving it everything he has to stay with them, but Chris is flying down the outside! Paul is trying to stay in touch, and now Mark and Dave are absolutely motoring from the back—what a finish this is going to be! \n\nIt's Steve! No, it's John! But wait, here comes Mike with a huge burst of speed! Adam is right there too, and Chris is not far behind! They’re all flying towards the finish line, it’s anyone's race now! \n\nSteve and John are still battling it out, but Mike is closing fast, and now Adam is finding something extra! Chris is still coming on strong, and here comes Mark out of nowhere with a late surge! Dave is also flying down the track—unbelievable scenes here as they approach the line!\n\nAnd it's... it's... it's JOHN! John just edges it out in a stunning finish! Steve and Mike are right there, almost too close to call for second! Adam finishes a strong fourth, followed by Chris, Greg, and Mark, with Dave and Paul just behind them! What a race! What a finish!
