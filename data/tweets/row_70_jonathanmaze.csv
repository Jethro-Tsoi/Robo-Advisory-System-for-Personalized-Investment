But that's a fundamentally different concept than the one that went public in 2015. \n\nShake Shack at 450 units was an experience. Shake Shack at 1,500 needs more everyday consumers. That will change what it means to be Shake Shack. It could put pressure on the brand to lower some prices. Or it will put pressure on the company to do a lot more marketing. It won't be easy. \n\nIn any event, such projections are not worth the paper they're printed on.
