"1791843518199087298","2024-05-18 22:49:20 +08:00","This is how GPT4o replied: Idiosyncratic investment convexity refers to the non-linear payoff structure of individual investments, where the potential for returns is asymmetric and can significantly deviate from a linear relationship with risk. In a diversified portfolio, understanding and leveraging this concept can enhance overall performance. Here are key points to consider:\n\n1. **Identification of Convex Opportunities**:\n   - **Options and Derivatives**: Investments like options inherently possess convexity. Buying options can provide significant upside with limited downside risk (premium paid).\n   - **Growth Stocks and Innovations**: Companies with potential for exponential growth, often in technology or biotech sectors, can exhibit convex returns.\n   - **Distressed Securities**: These can offer convex payoffs if the firm recovers more robustly than expected.\n   \n2. **Balancing Convex and Linear Assets**:\n   - Incorporate convex assets to capture outsized gains in favorable scenarios while maintaining a base of more predictable, linear-return investments to manage risk.\n   - Diversification benefits by offsetting potential losses from convex investments with stable returns from less volatile assets.\n\n3. **Risk Management**:\n   - Convex investments often involve higher volatility. Proper risk management strategies, including position sizing and hedging, are essential to prevent significant portfolio drawdowns.\n   - Understand the potential for extreme outcomes (both positive and negative) and stress test the portfolio under various scenarios.\n\n4. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**:\n   - Regularly review the portfolio to ensure the desired balance between convex and linear assets is maintained.\n   - Market conditions and individual asset performance can shift the portfolio’s risk profile, necessitating adjustments.\n\n5. **Performance Attribution**:\n   - Analyze the contribution of convex investments to overall portfolio performance. Successful convex bets can disproportionately drive returns.\n   - Be mindful of the psychological impact of convex investments, which can show poor performance over extended periods before delivering large gains.\n\n6. **The Role of Asymmetry**:\n   - Seek opportunities where the upside potential far outweighs the downside risk. Asymmetric bets, when correctly identified, can transform portfolio performance.\n   - Venture capital and private equity investments often aim for such asymmetry, betting on the high growth potential of a few winners.\n\n### Practical Application:\n\nConsider a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. Introducing convex investments, such as:\n   - **Small Allocation to Options**: Limited portion of capital in call options on high-growth stocks.\n   - **Venture Capital Funds**: Exposure to startups with potential for exponential growth.\n   - **Distressed Debt**: Investments in distressed assets with high recovery potential.\n\nRegularly assess and adjust the portfolio to maintain a strategic balance. Utilize quantitative models to gauge the impact of convexity on expected returns and risk, and apply qualitative judgment to understand market dynamics and investment fundamentals.\n\nBy thoughtfully incorporating idiosyncratic investment convexity, investors can enhance the potential for outsized returns while managing risk, ultimately aiming for a more robust and resilient portfolio.","[]","RodAlzmann","Rod Alzmann","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1798504363167567872/yO7xTWTh_normal.jpg","1791843516202557449","null","null",3,0,0,0,1,975,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1791843518199087298"

"1796951494836498585","2024-06-02 01:06:36 +08:00","If you max funded a Roth IRA on Jan 1st & bore risk solely through t-bills while participating in odd lot tenders, what kind of one year return should you expect?\n\nCurious if there's research on this subject... playing around w perplexity & tweaking some assumptions spit between ~15-30% in year one starting with a max Roth IRA contribution. Ofc as the account grows the % impact on returns would go down as offers wouldn't comprise as large a chunk of the capital base. Details:\n***\nBear Scenario: \n- 3 odd lot tender offers during the year\n- Each offer provides a 5% return over 3 weeks\n- Treasury bills yield 5.357% annually\n\nBull Scenario:\n- 5 odd lot tender offers during the year  \n- Each offer provides an 8% return over 3 weeks\n- Treasury bills yield 5.357% annually\n\nAssumptions for both scenarios:\n- Initial Roth IRA investment on January 1st: $7,000\n- All profits reinvested after each event\n\nBear Scenario (3 tenders at 5% returns):\n\n1. Starting Balance: $7,000\n\n2. First Tender (after 3 weeks):\n   - Return = $7,000 * (1 + 5%) - $7,000 = $350\n   - New balance = $7,000 + $350 = $7,350\n\n3. Treasury Returns (next 13 weeks): \n   - Return = $7,350 * (1 + 5.357%)^(13/52) - $7,350 = $177.31\n   - New balance = $7,350 + $177.31 = $7,527.31\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining 2 tenders.\n\n5. After the 3rd tender and final Treasury period, the approximate ending balance is:\n   - $8,054.62\n\nTherefore, in the Bear scenario with 3 odd lot tenders at 5% returns each, the estimated ending 2024 Roth balance is $8,054.62.\nPercentage Return = ($8,054.62 - $7,000) / $7,000 = 15.07%\n\nBull Scenario (5 tenders at 8% returns):\n\n1. Starting Balance: $7,000  \n\n2. First Tender (after 3 weeks):\n   - Return = $7,000 * (1 + 8%) - $7,000 = $560\n   - New balance = $7,000 + $560 = $7,560\n\n3. Treasury Returns (next 9 weeks):\n   - Return = $7,560 * (1 + 5.357%)^(9/52) - $7,560 = $101.79\n   - New balance = $7,560 + $101.79 = $7,661.79\n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining 4 tenders.\n\n5. After the 5th tender and final Treasury period, the approximate ending balance is: \n   - $9,098.41\n\nTherefore, in the Bull scenario with 5 odd lot tenders at 8% returns each, the estimated ending 2024 Roth balance is $9,098.41.\nPercentage Return = ($9,098.41 - $7,000) / $7,000 = 29.98%\n***\nFor those overseeing family finances, pouncing on these across members' accounts seems like a worthwhile few hours of time.
