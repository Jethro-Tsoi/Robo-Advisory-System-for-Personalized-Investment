It’s hard to hold onto a stock that gets a little expensive when 90% of the reason you bought it was because it was cheap. You are anchored to what it was, not what it is, or what it could be. It’s hard to pull up that anchor of value and raise the sail of growth. You need to grow with your investments to hold on and capture the right tail of life changing returns.\n\nhttps://t.co/ljcaqxSFA7","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",161,23,33,5,9,22290,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1838865894379782565"

"1853043330860360018","2024-11-03 19:55:32 +08:00","The hardest part of achieving a great long-term investment track record is over half the time your returns will look average. Especially if you are concentrated - you can go years where it feels like you are working hard for mediocre returns waiting for the fundamentals to backfill/multiples compress to springboard the portfolio to new highs. But then it finally happens and the previous year’s efforts, perhaps helped by a better macro environment create circumstances where you don't have to work as hard for your returns. The world works for you and pulls forward 5-10 years’ worth of returns and riches in a single year. “Whew” you feel smart again.\n\nOver the years I’ve realized a portfolio has a certain rhythm to it and the longer you invest the more you can tell whether the portfolio is in tune or out of tune. The “in tune” moments are amazing. The whole portfolio is in sync, not necessarily from a performance perspective, but just holistically you can feel it’s in perfect tune. Every instrument (stock) is doing what it’s supposed to be doing in perfect harmony. If you added a position or took one away it would hurt the portfolio and the rhythm.\n\nThen in a moment everything feels out of tune. The out of tune moments make you feel like you lost control. It might be from a surprise negative announcement from your largest position or just market forces pulling the portfolio lower for no reason. Or maybe it’s from just being wrong on your last few investments. You start to lose confidence. You become unsettled.\n\nLosing streaks compel you to do dumb things at the wrong time. You invest in new things you shouldn’t or double down on the wrong things (losers) trying to make back what you lost. You throw Hail Mary’s like there is 5 seconds left in a tie game when you don’t have to. It’s sort of what happened to Archie.

You must get good at forgetting and moving on so you stay in the rhythm.

The fish was found in the North Atlantic and word quickly spread to the west coast.\n\nThe question was, how could you get the cod fish across the country and still keep it fresh?\n\nAt first they tried to freeze the fish and ship it by railcar, but when the fish arrived and prepared it was mushy and lacked flavor.\n\nThen someone had the great idea of turning a railcar into a large aquarium and shipping the cod fish alive across the country. The fish would certainly stay fresh. But unfortunately, this was not the case. Even though it was transported alive, the cod was still mushy and tasteless.\n\nFinally someone studied the cod fish and discovered its natural predator was the catfish. They put a few catfish in each tank and shipped cod fish across the country. During the journey the catfish would chase the cod fish. When the cod fish arrived on the west coast and prepared it tasted fresh. In order for the cod fish to be fresh it had to be in an environment of catfish.\n\nDon’t go through life just standing there. Fresh means being uncomfortable. Fresh means you are being chased. We all want to go through life anxiety free, comfortable, and letting life take us where it wants. But God, destiny, whatever you want to call it puts catfish in our lives for a reason. Because you run the fastest when someone is chasing you. You pray the hardest when something is after you.

It’s hard to hold onto a stock that gets a little expensive when 95% of the reason you bought it was because it was cheap. You are anchored to what it was, not what it is, or what it could be. It’s hard to pull up that anchor of value and raise the sail of growth. It’s hard to grow with your investments so you can hold on and capture the right tail of life changing returns.\n\nIt's the same as past relationships. There are plenty of people that only remember you for who you were when they knew you. 5-10-20-30 years ago when you were a different person. Sometimes you cringe when you see certain people because they remind you of the person you used to be. You aren’t that person anymore. You've grown.

I always find it humorous when stock pickers define themselves as ""buy and hold"" investors because the reality is you aren't. You define your strategy by the 10% outliers when in reality a better reflection of your strategy and process is the 90% you didn't hold long-term. \n\nI'm a bit of an oddball because I do think about who will buy my stocks from me. Why? Because I will sell most of what I buy. \n\nI don't want to buy cheap things hoping and praying for reversion to the mean - someone else finds it slightly more appealing. I want to buy something that is undervalued that can get overvalued. Something that will excite the crowd and force others to buy the ask, not sit 20% below the bid. \n\nUnique businesses that can consistently sustain double digit organic growth, make more money, and not dilute will always attract institutional flows. They are like snowballs rolling downhill and it's just a matter of time until the size and velocity of the business increases to a point that pulls institutions in. \n\nThe higher the organic growth rate and higher the operating leverage the more it will excite the crowd and the sooner institutions will go downstream to buy them. A $30m revenue business organically growing 50%, and profitable will have a frenzy of institutions breaking their internal mandates to ""never go below a certain market cap"" or ""we never buy OTC"" to get their toe hold position in the equity.","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",104,16,39,1,11,15721,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1859596629487034410"

If you want to really learn - throw yourself into the deep end of the pool where research and opinions aren't spoon-fed to you like you're a child.

"1863907459271626920","2024-12-03 19:25:42 +08:00","What do you think separates a successful stock picker from an unsuccessful one? I think successful stock pickers share four characteristics regardless of their flavor of investing and duration.\n\nBoundless Curiosity – They are naturally curious human beings. They are always looking at new ideas, digging deeper (extreme paranoia) on current positions i.e. What you don’t own can’t hurt you. They enjoy learning about new things and areas and expanding their circle of competence.\n\nLooking down before they look up – We all want to find multi-baggers. The two necessary ingredients are earnings per share growth and multiple expansion. Your starting point, the price you pay matters. It’s why Buffett famously said, “price is my due diligence.” He didn’t mean that literally but meant to illustrate the importance. Great stock pickers focus on the downside before addressing the upside.\n\nDisconnect the stock price from the business – Far too often we let the stock price determine our conviction. If the stock increases our conviction increases. If the stock decreases our conviction decreases. To do the right thing at the right time an investor must track the business performance independent of the stock price. The ability to form extreme conviction when the stock is below intrinsic value.\n\nAn accurate vision for the future – They bring all the evidence and diligence together to form variant view of the future. They always remain rational and don’t let their expectations get too high. They don’t let the echo chamber of bullishness and endowment bias build up. They are always analyzing the real evidence, looking at today’s valuation against where they think the business will be 1-2-3 years ahead.","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",322,68,220,6,25,49815,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1863907459271626920"

The good management teams know it matters a lot especially in the early days.","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",147,15,16,5,7,19293,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1865180749084676312"

When we own something, we look for reasons to own more. So we focus on what could go right and what could accelerate growth - Not what could go wrong.\n\nWhen we buy something that is growing 20%, we only think about it growing 30%, not dropping back to 10%. When it happens we act surprised our excel model led us astray. \n\nWhen a company disappoints us, 50% of the time it’s management’s fault for overpromising and underdelivering. The other 50% we are normally to blame. We got too excited. \n\nWhen a business is doing well, we take the highest quarter ever posted and annualize it to justify the stock being cheap. This sometimes works but it often doesn’t. \n\nIt’s hard to control the bullish echo chamber in our brains. It doesn't take long for our expectations to get a full standard deviation away from reality. \n\nIt takes time, reps and discipline to learn to stay rational and conservative. Low(er) expectations is a good friend to a stock picker.

The result is people desire his opinion and approval. Business owners are willing to sell to him for less. Financiers are willing to give him a better deal to have him involved. When the markets are in free fall investors look to him to put in the floor and tell us it’s going to be okay. Reputation means influence.\n\nReputations take time to develop and can only be earned. They normally start from humble beginnings. Most of the people you admire today weren’t known by anyone the first 10 years of their career. They kept their heads down. They weren’t seen. They worked in unglamorous positions, but they started building a reputation that they could be relied upon.\n\nIf you're an investor looking to build your reputation - find a great company early before institutions. Do the work. Be public about it. Be the axe in the name (axe = no one knows the company better than you). Be right. Then do it again and again. If you can do this, it won’t matter whether you went to Harvard or flunked out of the 4th grade.

They are the leaders of the team and are paid the most, represented by position size. They have earned this right by performing over a period of time (going up) and building trust by performing through various circumstances. Even so, we stay vigilant and rational so we don’t overpay our veteran players for peak performance that is about to decline.  \n\nWe view our smaller positions like rookies on a professional sports team. They have the qualities we look for but are young and more unproven. We invest a little into them and give them some playing time and closely watch how they perform. A few will outperform under pressure and will deserve to be paid more (increase position size) and become core positions. Others won't perform under pressure so we'll kick them off the team and replace them with new prospects.","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",57,5,27,0,1,12200,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1880605384152428683"

You ""might"" be able to see the first ""bag"" but chances are you will still be wrong (you make 20% instead of 100%). \n\nIn many ways realizing a multi-bagger in the portfolio is as rare as flipping a coin every quarter and getting heads every time where execution, valuation, and future prospects are still favorable. Most microcap successes are 2-8 quarter success stories and then something changes for the worse and you must spot those changes before others so you don't give up all your gains before the rug gets pulled. \n\nThe small stocks that do go on to 5-10x+ and don't come back down are the exceptions, not the norm. You have no idea if/when the music will stop and it's why productive paranoia/maintenance due diligence is the most important skill for a microcap investor.","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",175,26,47,3,12,39060,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1883134248887939477"

Kirkpatrick then paid Lincoln $2 less than the agreed upon rate ($75 less in today’s dollars). Kirkpatrick stiffed him.\n\nA few months later Governor Reynolds of Illinois called for volunteers to join a militia against a Native American named Black Hawk.\n\nBlack Hawk was a Sauk leader who led raiding and war parties. The Sauk and Fox tribes ceded their lands in 1828 and were relocated west of the Mississippi river to the newly formed Iowa Indian Territory.\n\nIn 1832, Black Hawk became frustrated and moved 1500 of his people back to Illinois which sparked local militia groups to band together to force Black Hawk back to the Iowa territory.\n\nAmong the companies that responded was one from Menard County, Illinois.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was still seeking work and doing odd jobs, so he was the first to enlist, and it didn’t take long for the quota of men to be met.\n\nAn election was held among the company for whom was to be the captain. A few men wanted Lincoln.\n\nLincoln didn’t want the position, but finally consented to be a candidate.\n\nThe only other candidate was William Kirkpatrick, the man who previously mistreated Lincoln, and who was one of the most influential men in the area.\n\nThe election process was simple. Lincoln stood on one side of the room and Kirkpatrick stood on the other side. Each man of the company was to choose their leader by standing beside either Lincoln or Kirkpatrick.\n\nImmediately, 75% of the men stood beside Lincoln. When it was obvious Lincoln was going to win, the few standing next to Kirkpatrick left him, and stood next to Lincoln.\n\nKirkpatrick was left all alone. Lincoln the wronged laborer was now his ex-employer’s captain.\n\nLater in life, Abraham Lincoln said no other success during his entire lifetime had given him half the satisfaction he felt that day.\n\nhttps://t.co/cOZYPjS6gM","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",109,12,26,2,7,20805,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1891487262912774235"

It could magnify objects 20-30x their normal size.\n\nA few decades later Antonie van Leeuwenhoek started experimenting with microcopes by grinding his own lenses. His microscope looked more like a magnifying glass. He could magnify an object up to 200x.\n\nAt the same time Robert Hooke was experimenting with microscopes. Unlike Leeuwenhoek, Hooke’s microcscope were true compound microscopes. \n\nThey were less powerful, but offered greater ease of use and broader perspective, allowing him to capture larger structures in his drawings.\n\nSince photography wasn’t invented yet, Hooke would spend countless hours observing magnified objects and then drawing what he saw by hand. He used a graticule (a grid) to help him get a sense for relative size of what he was observing.\n\nWhen Robert Hooke published “Micrographia” in 1665 it immediately became a best seller.\n\nOne of Hooke's most famous illustrations is of a flea, which he showed in almost monstrous detail. It captivated adults and children and was as much an artistic marvel as a scientific one.\n\nNo matter a person’s age or socioeconomic status, Hooke’s magnified images of blue mold, hair, skin, snowflakes, a fly’s eye, feathers, fish scales, and a nettle sting captivated everyone. \n\n“Micrographia” encouraged the public and scientists alike to question what other mysteries might be hidden just out of sight.\n\nThis simple picture book became the catalyst for widespread curiosity, single handedly propelling the scientific revolution in physics, biology, and engineering.\n\nAll this simply by letting people clearly see a microscopic world that was always there.\n\nhttps://t.co/UAiRiIuE1q","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",59,8,19,0,6,13400,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1896180482934739112"

But there is a huge difference between a $10 million market cap and a $200 million market cap business. \n\nA $10 million market cap is a hustle. \n\nA $200 million market cap has proven they can scale.\n\nIn my early investing career, I made a lot of money investing in $15 million market cap companies growing into a $50 million market cap companies. \n\nThe beauty of hustles is it doesn’t take much fundamental progress to make this 200% move. If management can get to sustained profitability, the stock will likely make that move. In fact, it might only take a narrative or sentiment shift to the story.\n\nBut eventually the business hits a ceiling. Most hustles can’t scale past $50 million market cap.\n\nThe business will always rise and fall to the quality level of the management. \n\nYou eventually get to THE QUESTION.\n\nIs this the CEO, founder, management that can transition from hustle to scale? Can they cross the chasm from $50 million to $200 million? \n\nhttps://t.co/hu2Z04yxT3","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",179,24,52,3,8,36870,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1898750138127892759"

The only thing that stops the slide is a company smashing this quarter's estimates/expectations. Anything less and it gets punished. Being flat on the day is the new up. Stocks you never thought you would ever be able to buy are buyable. But everything now looks the same - everything looks like a double in 2-3 years so you stick to what you own. This is what a drawdown looks like.","[]","iancassel","Ian Cassel","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1097867495795580928/StA4BEoF_normal.png","null","null","null",152,15,30,1,5,15805,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/iancassel/status/1900904919290327531"
