Bill Ackman, David Sacks, Dan Loeb, Ben Shapiro, all the loudest Trump supporters this time around - all Jewish guys.\n\nThese white nationalists didn't show up in the polls in 2016 but they showed up in the election. In 2024, white nationalists are showing up in the polls (some for irony reasons, others as a strategy because they know they're a voting bloc) but won't show up in numbers in the election.\n\nThere are actually almost as many true white nationalists as there are Jewish people in the US. White nationalists are about 2% of population while Jews are about 2.5%. (I'm not really counting partial Jewish people who don't really participate culturally, and I'm also not really counting casual white nationalists i.e. people who just listen to a few podcasts here or there.)\n\nI really don't think it's possible for Trump to win without the white nationalists showing up.\n\nIt may make you uncomfortable to think or talk about this, but this is the voting bloc that matters.\n\n---\n\nFinal proof is that the Trump Campaign fired a white nationalist today, one day before the election. (Trump doesn't actually want to win, by the way, the man himself cares way more about running a campaign than he does governing.)\n\nThe white nationalists are rippin' about this in their channels today. They're going to stay home.\n\nThere goes another 30k-ish votes in Pennsylvania for Trump, another 18k-ish in Michigan, a few thousand in Georgia, of white nationalists who haven't already voted.\n\nAll that really matters now is how much street cash is out in Philadelphia tomorrow and I honestly don't see any proof that there won't be plenty of street cash moving.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/B7tZ08sbVn"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gbl8dkYWIAA_ypO?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gbl8dkYWIAA_ypO?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","null",122,13,35,4,19,28829,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1853651138794447021"

He has a track record of financing drug trafficking and money laundering operations.\n\nHis whole VC thing is just a front. That's just the vehicle through which he runs these operations.\n\nFor example: \n\n-David Sacks bankrolled a company called Done Global. The ""CEO"" Ruthia He is a Chinese national with absolutely no medical experience. Very quickly, this turned into prescriptions for dead people, medspas doling out Adderall, the Chinese sharing health data about Americans as the whole back office was in China. Plenty of these narcotics ended up on the street, which was always the goal.\n\nThe CEO and several others are awaiting trial. They caught David Sacks-backed Ruthia He trying to flee to China about a month ago, and now she's back in jail.\n\n-David Sacks had a whole money laundering operation set up around Eaze. His guy Keith McCarty left Eaze to found a payments system company (to support Eaze) and they have Keith McCarty with crack cocaine, prostitutes, and firearms rooming with a guy named Hamid Arkhavan involved in the Wirecard fraud, running up transactions to facilitate money laundering through porn sites. Eaze was a big advertiser on these sites to clear money laundering transactions.\n\n-Earlier this year, conservative influencer Dave Rubin was caught up in a money laundering racket after he and his people were receiving payments from Russian assets, and the Russian fled the US overnight. Dave Rubin is another David Sacks-backed founder. Rubin was co-founder of the company Locals, which is extremely crappy Web 1.0 software used to facilitate payments to influencers. David Sacks sold this Locals plus his other company Callin, to Rumble $RUM and took a Board seat at Rumble.\n\nThere. Right there you have 3 David Sacks-backed founders all directly tied to money laundering and/or drug trafficking. Ruthia He. Keith McCarty. Dave Rubin.\n\nThose are just the main ones with some amount of legal/media coverage on them, but there are more.\n\nYou still think Sacks is ""just"" a VC? The VC stuff is a front.\n\nThis isn't tech. This is the Mafia. Sacks just throws the word ""software"" over it to obfuscate it, but too many people have figured this out now.\n\nHe got too cocky after he and Lonsdale ""lost"" a bunch of foreign money with Hyperloop.\n\nHis prancing around is like watching an animal in a cage. He's got to negotiate his way out of this regardless. \n\nEven if Trump wins, he's got an uphill battle but if Harris wins it's over.\n\nSo I voted for Kamala Harris to help facilitate and move forward getting David Sacks' drugs off the street and his money laundering channels shut down.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/Sri98HqRcU"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GboumUXWQAAwIX2?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GboumUXWQAAwIX2?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1853820562780348790",2668,438,771,78,82,348648,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1853850363004063977"

Gen Xers check Zillow and Redfin and the like to look up their parents' house prices and comps the same way Gen Z broccoli heads check sports betting parlays.\n\nHere's where it gets funny.\n\nIt's imperative that Gen Xers liquidate their parents' property now and ship mom and dad off to the budget nursing home ASAP.\n\nNow, if Trump starts deporting everyone this means residential real estate prices will fall quicker than expected and these bequeathments will become less valuable.\n\nSo now the Gen X Zillow checkers are in a race against the clock. They need to get mom and dad to sell the house and shipped out now while residential real estate remains high.\n\nIt's a very good time to be long elderly care facilities. I would not bet against greedy Gen Xers religiously checking Zillow right now.\n\nMost people will sell out their parents for a surer bet today than speculation tomorrow.","[{""type"":""animated_gif"",""url"":""https://t.co/chYSmR1ZuW"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/Gbw-M8CXoBEi6wh.jpg?name=thumb"",""original"":""https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/Gbw-M8CXoBEi6wh.mp4"",""ext_alt_text"":""Ben Stiller Hand Gesture GIF""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1854178864026509406",76,3,29,1,10,24412,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1854425545506738184"

It seems like she tries to murder Mr. Pitt with a pillow.\n\n✅Pillow murder. ✅ Inheritance issues.\n\n-The Sopranos, top late 1990s/2000s drama, launched the ""anti-hero"" archetype:\n\nTony is set to murder his mother with a pillow, when she fakes a stroke. Much of the drama around Tony, his mother, and the family is based around who inherits ""the New Jersey mob"" from Uncle Junior and who inherits Tony's mother's home between Tony and his sister Janice.\n\nThis whole show in the early seasons is about battling elderly family members before it shifts in later seasons to battling one's own kids and younger family members.\n\nTony also essentially pillow murders Christopher, his young protege, toward the end of the series. Christopher will not inherit the NJ mob.\n\n✅Pillow murders. ✅ Inheritance issues.\n\n-Game of Thrones, top 2010s drama:\n\nDaenerys murders her husband Khal Drogo with a pillow to set off the chain of events leading her to inherit the Dothraki who will help her make her claim to inherit the Throne of Westeros, which she believes is her birthright.\n\n✅Pillow murder. ✅ Inheritance issues.\n\n---\n\nEveryone is murdering everyone with pillows all the time, usually to facilitate estate transfers.\n\nNow that we're entering the mass death event of Boomers dying off, pillow murders will be front of mind.\n\nI actually think life expectancy in the US will decline as more 79, 80 year-olds are murdered with pillows for their estates, when if they weren't pillow murdered they would have lived to 83, 84, 85, etc. \n\nWe, as a society, will shave off life expectancy in the last few years of Boomer life in order to pull forward The Great Generational Wealth Transfer, so we younger generations can get what is ours from the greedy Boomers who have hoarded so much wealth.\n\nMuch of this will be especially concentrated in real estate bubbles like Florida, Dallas, TX, Arizona where mass deportations will kill the prices of residential real estate.","[{""type"":""animated_gif"",""url"":""https://t.co/KBrW3M4Pk2"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/Gb3-IRsXAAA8kl7.jpg?name=thumb"",""original"":""https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/Gb3-IRsXAAA8kl7.mp4"",""ext_alt_text"":""Tony Soprano Sopranos GIF""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1854745189757468873",22,1,5,2,9,9813,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1854918045946302472"

L/S equities is back (what I like!) and going to gain from bubbled private credit. This was going to happen anyway - Trump just accelerates it a bit vs. Harris.\n\nTrump's volatility comes from how he power balances white nationalists vs. Jewish financiers.\n\nBig Q: \n\na. Is Trump going to repeat all the white nationalist nonsense from his first admin eg. ""Jews will not replace us"" tiki torches and Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon (who hates Jews) and Mexican kids separated from parents.\n\nb. Is Trump going to break toward all the loud financier types screaming about his greatness, who are mostly Jewish (Bill Ackman, Dan Loeb, David Sacks, Joe Lonsdale).\n\nThese two coalitions are always in conflict.\n\nProblem is, all the loudest Jewish financiers I specifically mentioned are dirty as hell with huge baggage.\n\nSome idiot is going to claim I'm anti-semitic (and I'll be sure to laugh about that when I join my in-laws at temple and when I'm making brisket and latkes) but these 4 specifically and a few others are very dirty.\n\n---\n\nThe first Trump Administration was a power struggle between white nationalists and Jewish financiers and both coalitions fundamentally hate one another.\n\nIf mass deportations happen (what white nationalists want) it will affect Jewish financiers as asset prices fall and real estate prices drop. The white nationalists would love to deport Latinos and ""stick it"" to Jewish financiers.\n\nIf Trump leans into Israel, it leaves open the hole for white nationalists to take into their own hands the deportations and these will be sloppy and fail eg. a bunch of redneck cops running around trying to deport people named ""Jose Martinez"" who are like third-generation Americans and have real jobs and pay real taxes. A shitshow.\n\n---\n\nYou won't hear this kind of analysis anywhere else because nobody wants to talk about the struggle between white nationalists and a specific set of Jewish financiers as the power struggle Trump has always faced, but this is the way the world works.\n\nStephen Miller is the crux between the two worlds because he's both a white nationalist and self-loathing Jew in his public persona but he's actually Jewish and has ties to deep Jewish money.\n\nStephen Miller is your key to understanding Trump trades.\n\n---\n\nI lean into the vomit and darkness of how these money networks and power dynamics work so that others don't have to deal with the nonsense.

What about this company's story is just forecasts of hypothetical stuff vs. actual AI in use?\n\nThis is playing out first at the application/software layers; doesn't really affect the hyperscalers or chips just yet.","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1855828863621665055",69,3,27,2,2,66603,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1855834189255352783"

She's the hot teacher/mom character from their teenage years, the older lady who if she takes off her glasses and puts down her hair becomes the ultimate MILF.\n\nTina Fey is a savvy businesswoman and she's played this whole schtick her whole career. In fact, one of the memes or inside joke from her show is the fake reality show MILF Island where a bunch of young men and middle aged women are paired up together and sex abounds.\n\nBooking's sex tourism business is perfect because they're not actually selling the customer the hooker - they're just selling 99.9% of the journey to the hooker, the plane tickets to get to the hooker, the hotel for banging the hooker, and event tickets you can buy to venues where hookers congregate.\n\nBut they don't actually sell the customer the hooker.\n\nSo at Booking $BKNG we've got Tina Fey in a bathrobe who appeals to women as the ultimate mom and to men as the MILF from their childhoods as the spokesperson and face of the brand, we've got Booking selling you 99.9% of the journey to exotic hookers and they're advertising on porn sites, and competing with this we have $ABNB where the CEO is waxing philosophical about the nature of boss-employee 1x1 meetings. 🪁\n\nAlso $ABNB's Brian Chesky designed the penis mascot at RISD called Scrotie.

Every incremental synthetic diamond entering the market reduces the value of every incremental natural diamond entering the market.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nThe diamond market is fixed by Israelis, who also manage what's called the ""Kimberly Scheme"" - a certification process that regulates trade in rough diamonds, ostensibly set up to limit the amount of ""blood diamonds"" circulating in the market.\n\nWhile the Ramat Gan exchange in Israel is the clearinghouse, plenty of money launders of all stripes and backgrounds use the high vig Israeli cut diamond market (about 25% of Israel's exports, by the way) to launder money, but this is a contracting business model as synthetic diamonds are taking over much of this market.\n\nIt's simply becoming harder and harder to launder money through the diamond trade, with worse volumes and higher vigs.\n\nPlus, there are a ton of diamonds held by Boomers (obviously as engagement ring jewelry, but just in general) and as these people die off, more and more already-cut diamonds will re-enter the market, further driving down the cost efficiency of laundering money through the diamond cutting trade.\n\n---\n\nSo if you've got a ton of money to launder, what you do now is you clear this through AdTech.\n\nYou set up entities on both sides of the market - you buy ad space from one entity located somewhere in the world, you set up digital property on the other side to host these ads - a site or app or whatever, and you have a bot network set up to run up impressions and play pricing on an ad exchange.\n\nThe middlemen here are these AdTech companies that turn a blind eye to this (to give them the most credit... some do actively participate).\n\nNow if you're money laundering what you also may wish to do is buy equity (stock) in these middlemen who are making all these great transactions and facilitating transfers. Now you're legally making money off the volume of money laundering you and others are doing.\n\nIf you wish to understand app data, ad data, bot networks, simply start with how much diamond marketshare is being taken over by synthetic diamonds and how many already-cut diamonds re-enter the supply chain as estates are liquidated as Boomers die off.\n\nI can't take any AdTech analyst seriously if they don't also track how much allocation is moving out of the diamond trade and into AdTech.","[{""type"":""animated_gif"",""url"":""https://t.co/4Wg2PbGHBb"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/GdVugNjWMAEcUA0.jpg?name=thumb"",""original"":""https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/GdVugNjWMAEcUA0.mp4"",""ext_alt_text"":""Dr Joy Shine On GIF""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1861456445197201689",302,35,356,13,30,136169,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1861515527060873586"

So let's ask her! \n\nShe's on the a16z ""American Dynamism"" team, so that means defense investing and data collection and stuff like that.\n\nI'm genuinely curious, and I think many will also be curious, to hear what Ms. Price-Wright thinks about things as an early career woman working in tech investing, specifically around defense investing.\n\n-This is a great opportunity for you to ask questions.\n-This is not a bullying exercise.\n-This is not a political exercise and you may have different opinions than she, which is okay, but please be respectful.\n-I will delete any comments featuring harassment or nonsense, so let's please keep it cordial and proper with genuine questions.\n\n---\n\nMy questions (a launching off point) for Ms. Price-Wright @espricewright are here:\n\n1) What are a16z ""American Dynamism"" GP David Ulevitch's plans for instituting a national draft? \n\nIn January, Mr. Ulevitch stated to Politico @politico that he was in favor of a mandatory national draft of America's young people.\n\nThis can be seen here: https://t.co/xHZoPzl7X2\n\nIs Andreessen Horowitz in favor of a national draft? If so, how can people think about this?\n\nHow does being a defense investor with clear money ties to foreign powers impact how you may think about this potential mandatory draft? Why should American youth be drafted into a system where they work on and use the hardware (like Anduril) Andreessen Horowitz finances?

These guys love building prisons and running them and though this industry isn't without its problems, we're all generally better off for it.\n\nIf you don't believe me:\n\n-Which group of immigrants has the most prison guards per capita? Armenians.\n\n-Who builds the most prisons? Armenians.\n\n-Which politician signed off on building the most prisons and tripled the number of inmates in California? That would be former California Governor George Deukmejian, an Armenian.\n\nThese guys love prisons.\n\n---\n\nNow why is this important for ServiceTitan $TTAN?\n\nWell, ServiceTitan handles scheduling, payments, and employee/contractor data for the construction industry, which is heavily made up of Latino immigrants who are often undocumented and here in the US outside of the law.\n\nSo we've got payments moving back and forth, data about humans and where they live and work and where they're physically located, and a large number of these people can be detained and fed into the prison system - it's just a matter of rounding them up.\n\n---\n\nSo with President-Elect Trump and Stephen Miller about to round up hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of ""illegal"" immigrants we have to ask ourselves who has the best data set and who can track payments and physically locate humans and provide receipts?\n\nWell, that's ServiceTitan $TTAN. It's the Armenians.🇦🇲\n\nOnce these people are found, tagged, and logged they will enter the prison industrial complex, which is also run by the Armenians.\n\nSo the Armenians have a pipeline here - the full stack. The top-of-funnel is ServiceTitan $TTAN which gives them insights into who potential prisoners are. The bottom-of-funnel is the prison industrial complex.\n\nThe Armenians make money twice, and they have huge negotiating leverage since they have one of the most important data sets for the Trump Administration.\n\nI know this may make people feel icky or uncomfortable, but I'm sorry to tell you that this is how the world works and moving human beings around from Point A to Point B is the world's second-oldest profession.\n\nGood IPO.

Part of this is because of all the Nazi elements traditionally present in New Jersey.\n\n-Charles Lindbergh was a Nazi. He lived in New Jersey and when his baby was murdered it created many conspiracy theories, launching the modern conspiracy theory movement.\n\n-During WWII there were always Nazi U-Boats off the coast of New Jersey. Even to this day there are alcoholics in New Jersey using metal detectors to scan the beaches to find washed up Nazi stuff. Nobody ever finds anything. The whole Jersey Shore is like this.\n\n-One of the greatest air disasters in history - the Hindenburg Disaster - was literally a Nazi zeppelin blowing up on a US military base, which leads to more Nazi conspiracy theories.\n\n-There's actually a Nazi U-Boat sunk off the coast of New Jersey.\n\n-New Jersey's main newspaper and source of media for decades, even today, is The Star-Ledger  which was created in 1937 by a Jewish businessman to counter media Naziism in New Jersey. The main competitor of The Star-Ledger was The Newark Evening News which was somewhat pro-Nazi, so it was back-and-forth with messaging to New Jerseyans depending on which newspaper you read.\n\n-There's a crazy guy in New Jersey who was in the New Jersey newspapers for years in the early 2000s who had changed his name to Heath Hitler and named his son Adolf Hitler and would go around to ShopRites and get them to make cakes that said ""Happy Birthday, Adolf Hitler"" and then all the alcoholic wine moms in New Jersey would get mad at him and documentary-maker and lifelong chronic alcoholic Morgan Spurlock made a documentary about this guy in 2014. \n\nSo we have alcoholics making documentaries for other alcoholics about a crazy Hitler guy and everyone is mad at everyone else about all this.\n\n---\n\nThe entire State of New Jersey is run by alcoholism and Nazi hysteria, so naturally when flashing lights appear in the sky it riles up generational dementia.","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1868091332360839422",51,3,12,2,4,31798,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1868099396476289117"

If ServiceTitan deems it necessary to improve their business by providing the locations of thousands of undocumented immigrants then there you go.\n\n-""We may collect and store your location information, including GPS coordinates""...I mean, they're obviously doing this because they have in their platform offerings the ability to deliver via UIs where end users are located in very close to real time as a feature.\n\nSo if ServiceTitan needs to comply with ""applicable laws"" or they deem it necessary to ""improve their business"" they can share location data, scheduling data, really any of the data they collect and store at all with anyone.\n\nThis is invaluable data to an incoming Trump Administration that is seeking to locate and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. ServiceTitan is a one-stop-shop for running job site raids which is what the Administration seems to be leaning toward.\n\nThe only question is whether ServiceTitan $TTAN is going to partner on this or fight it.

"1869414862691987559","2024-12-19 00:10:09 +08:00","The relational database (1970s) is what allows for securitization, underpins software, and is why post-Bretton Woods ethnic minorities and women could open credit lines in the US without, frankly, a white male co-signer. The relational database is what allows ""scoring"" of individuals, entities, etc. in a way more robust than saying, ""Gee this guy seems like he'll pay me back so I'll lend him some money.""\n\nWhen IBM researcher Edgar F. Codd published a paper in 1970 titled ""A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"" that theorized the relational database model, we kicked off modern finance.\n\nBy being able to price nearly 100% of an adult population and lend to it based on data instead of lending to ~40% of a population based on handshakes, we created modern finance in the US and the floating US dollar became the world's reserve currency.\n\nPlus, at this time women began to go to college en masse instead of just normal schools (teaching colleges) or nursing schools. They took these college educations and began working in white collar jobs where they'd input data into relational databases, extract data from relational databases, analyze data in relational databases, etc. and all of this made it possible to take on larger amounts of loans and for consumer lending products to become more complex.\n\nI'm not sure we've actually entered a Sixth Phase yet. The relational database is still going too strong.\n\nGreat table, but missing the most important part!","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1869404274247311507",131,14,74,2,7,28079,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1869414862691987559"

Hindutva says the Indian male, of high caste, must be above all else, by his birthright.\n\nThis rot pervades in many tech companies. In fact, it's often something I look for in researching businesses that are great short candidates. When the Hindutva nationalism takes over, management has lost.

If your IT team takes 5x-10x as long to complete requests for women, Muslims, non-Hindus as it takes them to complete requests for Hindus, your business has likely been taken over by Hindutvas.\n\nYou can run these reports right now, today, if you'd like.\n\n2) Ask yourself, if you're a woman or a non-Hindu minority, do you have to have a chaperone Hindu or White man with you when you make requests of your IT team? If you have to have chaperones act as go-betweens for you to make requests of IT but Hindus or White men can ask once and be serviced immediately without friction, your business has likely been taken over by Hindutva nationalists. They run your business now and it's up to you to decide whether it's salvageable.\n\nMost businesses in the small cap/mid cap range that are taken over by Hindutvas at far too small a size are absolutely tasty, fantastic short candidates because the business is no longer about being a business but about making a business-inside-the-business.","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","null",490,43,226,65,88,144485,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1872802758715412615"

Here's what we did to solve our stray dog problems in the United States:\n\nWe gave all the town drunks big nets and badges and we sent them on missions to catch all the stray dogs and take them to dog jail.\n\nThis solves multiple problems at once. \n\nFirst, the stray dogs get off the streets and this reduces rabies and other diseases. ✅\n\nSecond, all the alcoholics who would be begging or taking up space and adding social costs have something to do now. Go find the loose stray dogs, put the stray dogs in the big net, and take the stray dogs to dog jail. Repeat.✅\n\nThird, by removing the stray dogs and not letting them breed, the stray dog population does not compound at such a high rate. ✅\n\nRight now on Temu there are big nets going for $11.84 and Animal Control Officer t-shirts for $10.22.\n\nEvery town in India should buy 50 big nets and 50 Animal Control Officer t-shirts today. That's $1100.\n\nThen, go down to the town jail, round up all the alcoholics, and tell them they are going to be animal control officers and their job is to round up the stray dogs. They will get paid $2.50 or one pack of Kingfisher beer for every stray dog they round up and take to dog jail.\n\nIf you don't have a dedicated dog jail, what you do is you use the jail cells the alcoholics are no longer in and you use that for dogs now instead of the town drunks.\n\nWithin 2 weeks you will start to see immediate changes. Rabies will go down. The alcoholics will have something to do and will cause less trouble. There will be Big Net Brigades roaming the streets.\n\nThis makes too much sense, so it probably won't be done, but this is basically what we did here in the United States and it more or less works. 🇺🇸🦅\n\nBig nets: give it a try!

Chuck Myers lands the plane?\n\nThe key to understanding a Veradigm bull case may lie in Science dot io's API documentation.\n\n$MDRX bought Science dot io during an ""AI hype"" phase, yet Science dot io's API documentation shows that this project is more or less an undergrad CS 101 text scraping project with a social media thinkfluencer slapped on top.\n\nThe main problem here is that Science dot io positioned itself as a way to ""automate"" or streamline PHI and health data by pulling data and classifying it out of text entries. Yet on the API docs we can see that the advertised accuracy for fields/keys like ""Medical Record"" or ""Phone"" have only 83% and 84% accuracy respectively.\n\nThe reason EHR record/medical data processing is so manual in general is because this requires precision AND accuracy.\n\nThis silly nonsense adds a problem. Now you have two problems: the problem that it takes a while to manually validate EHR data + you bought a new solution to automate the first problem but it doesn't work very well. In some cases, you may have three problems is you had to hire an engineer to fiddle with Science dot io, and you've implemented a new solution, and none of this is accurate enough to solve your original time problem.\n\nI don't know who is going to be picking up this bag. The Veradigm CEO who bought Science dot IO was fired shortly thereafter and that's after the previous CEO was fired for years of audit issues, the company can't get out proper financials, and Science dot io seems to be a B-/C+ undergrad end-of-semester project.

Very proud of the folks who have stepped up. 💪\n\nFor my next ask on $APP:\n\n-I'd like a mapping of some of these fraudulent medical claims that come from ads from AppLovin properties and partners, seemingly heavily concentrated in Cyprus studios staffed by Russians and Belarusians. I'm especially interested in fake medical claims around Alzheimer's, dementia, and mental illness-related ads but all other diseases or chronic conditions as well.\n\n-American citizens are targeted with these absurd snake oil cures, which $APP uses to get downloads on properties, including PeopleFun gaming studio, which AppLovin owns.\n\n-It's absurd to see PeopleFun's ""Values"" page on their corporate website about building trust and being vulnerable, but if you dig into this $APP company you see what's really going on - a bunch of completely absurd ads with actors dressed in doctor costumes claiming that by playing word search style games people can reduce their exposure to dementia, Alzheimer's, and related mental conditions. 🤣 These are ads targeting vulnerable Americans to pump downloads for Wall Street and to collect medical-related data on Americans, which then goes God knows where into this Belarusian/Russian network.\n\n-You may also find that there is a large crossover with Duolingo $DUOL, where these AppLovin ads are placed.\n\n-You can find Reddit threads and other info about this as it relates to $DUOL if you'd like more background info.\n\nMy ask:\n\n-I already have several playthroughs and screen recordings of these insane medical claims getting served through AppLovin and directing users to AppLovin properties. I want more. I want a deeper net. Go down the rabbit hole.\n\n-Download Voodoo, PeopleFun, Lion Studios, or Playrix games and play through with your screen recording on.

I expect this is the work of a Molly Donaldson and Waverly Research - she runs a rent-a-cop/rent-a-spy PI firm that $ZETA hired to bother both me and seemingly anyone else who has been looking into $ZETA (Zeta Global).\n\nI have this rent-a-spy firm bothering me and my family now (LOL good luck bothering my family of spooks and 2nd Amendment zealots; let's see how doing stupid shit like FOIA-ing my dad works out for you, you're on your own, I'm the smartest and least crazy Balik so good luck with any of that). I was even tailed and followed around the LA area the last few weeks when I was there visiting my in-law family for the holidays.\n\nI can burn at least one of the rent-a-spies tailing me because I have my own spies following these spies, but I don't even really care? I don't want to put a working person out of work? Also I don't really care, this is just out of respect?\n\nIf you're going to tail me around, don't you think I already have tails on you? This is not kindergarten. I was born into this stuff.\n\n---\n\nMy favorite recent development from the rent-a-spy idiots running FOIAs on and bothering my family and me is a car parked near my home, which has license plates appearing, going away, and reappearing with people coming into the car to try and watch me, which started last month with this firm $ZETA hired.\n\nThis Jeep Latitude parked near my house has had idiots with cameras going in and out of it, and I know the game, the game is to get pictures of me walking to the grocery store or whatever to send to their client to ""show progress"" to make more billable hours. This is how the PI model works and the dumber or more desperate the client is the more of this nonsense they will buy.\n\nYesterday, I sent an email to Molly to just contact me and quit screwing around and then magically the license plates on this car on my street disappeared again. 🤷‍♀️\n\nLMFAO. Again, I was born into this stuff. You are going down a rabbit hole you don't want to go down.\n\nAbsolute fucking clown shop this Waverly Research hired by $ZETA or some $ZETA investor or related party to bother me.\n\n---\n\nSince the car parked near my home had appeared ajar and it has license plates appearing and going away and reappearing again and I heard a noise inside, I knocked on and then opened the door in case a child or person was inside. It was unlocked.\n\nThese rent-a-spy idiots are so dumb I found receipts inside from their meals, which fell out. I have all the receipts, all the data, etc. \n\nAgain, I won't burn any working people (usually former cops) working for Molly or this $ZETA crew but you guys have to do better if you want to be real PIs instead of screwing around!\n\n---\n\nI've got a free and chill evening tonight.\n\n👉If anyone in NYC wants to come hang out and point and laugh at a rent-a-spy car with missing license plates on my street and wants a tour of this car and to know how this works, give me a shout, we can have a beer and I'll show you how these spy cars work, my treat ;) You'll never get an opportunity like this again, I guarantee it, and I'm dead serious, hit me up if you're interested.\n\nI'm up near Columbia University, Morningside, Harlem area.\n\nThe car is sitting on my street near my house - I've already been through it. I'm not quite sure how they're going to extract it but it will all be logged and taped when it's extracted, so it's probably just going to be towed at this point.\n\n🍻\n\n(Btw, I've already got the Texas registry and Texas data for this car, and I won't share it out of respect.)","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/00H9x7IDLB"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg90z_sXQAAhpC6?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg90z_sXQAAhpC6?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/00H9x7IDLB"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg923GTXgAAR93S?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg923GTXgAAR93S?format=png&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/00H9x7IDLB"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg923GWWEAEX_Ru?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg923GWWEAEX_Ru?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/00H9x7IDLB"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg923GXXgAAJmzX?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg923GXXgAAJmzX?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","null",123,8,34,2,14,34234,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1877855743753236789"

"1878255407140864024","2025-01-12 09:39:20 +08:00","Love Concord, MA area. If you want a fun day trip for you and family here's what you do:\n\n1/ You visit a book store like the one below and you buy a book off this shelf.\n\n2/ You visit Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord and you spend an hour in reflection of the accomplishments of the people buried there. Take a walk around. It's open to the public.\n\nThey have everyone in this cemetery from the guy who directed the original Star Trek and I Love Lucy to Ralph Waldo Emerson to Louisa May Alcott to war heroes like ""Moose"" Heyliger from the 101st Airborne Easy Company, which folks may know from the Band of Brothers mini-series program.\n\nPull up an old Star Trek or I Love Lucy on your phone and watch it as you stand next to the grave of the guy who made that, who is buried in the ground a stone's throw away from Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\n3/ Then, you read a passage from the book you just bought next to the grave of the writer who wrote those words. You can read this out loud or you can just read it quietly.\n\nHow cool is this? You're reading the words of a famous author from 100+ years ago who had something to say about something and you're reading that dead person's thoughts over that dead person's grave. What an honor!\n\n4/ Next, you visit Minuteman National Park right down the street, which has the Old North Bridge, where the American Revolution commenced. You walk over the bridge and you read the plaques and you think about what it was like for a bunch of farmers to pull together their arms to defend their town to fight off the British - the most organized and armed army the world had seen at the time. You read the stories about how the town was burning and that is what called all the country folk to arms. But did it burn? If it did burn, was the fire started by American colonists themselves or the British? We'll never know the answer.\n\n5/ Then, you go to brunch or lunch at the restaurant Fourth & Field down the road ~20 mins away, which is next to a small airport with a big window facing the airport. The food is basic American fare - nothing special - but you go to the restaurant to watch the planes take off, but really you go to watch the little kids rooting for the planes.\n\n6/ If you really want you can go to Walden Pond and look at how goofy the cabin is. Seriously, this is a hilariously small cabin. You may comment on how commercial the place has gotten but just take a long walk around the perimeter of the pond and how commercial can a place really be if the walking paths have so much overgrowth?\n\n---\n\nThese little kids love these planes and they cheer for them.\n\nThis airport restaurant is a beautiful place because it's the funniest thing in the world to watch little 3 - 6 year olds rooting for the planes coming in or taking off, and you laugh and smile at them and their parents, but it's seriously the funniest thing in the world to watch the excitement of little kids cheering on these little airplanes.\n\n---\n\nYou can do the whole Concord, MA trip in about 5 hours and you'll live more in those few hours than you would watching Netflix or pretending to learn a new language on Duolingo.\n\nBig fan of watching the little babies running around cheering for airplanes taking off and landing...\n\nBig fan of all the humanity going on in the Concord, MA area...what a delight and what a joy to experience!","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/UDBDggR9kN"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhDj6ouWwAA9C1V?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhDj6ouWwAA9C1V?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1878191433489743884",55,3,25,0,3,14721,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1878255407140864024"

I told the property owners on my street about the spy car. I'm buddies with some of these people and they all know me, and at this point your spy car with license plates getting moved around then disappearing is just an abandoned car and this would now be considered ""derelict"" by DSNY and NYPD so just come grab the spy car or it's getting torched. You or some contractor probably want your spy car back I'd assume? Somebody wants the car, I'd think? Or is this just a tax write-off?\n\n---\n\nToday, I have a new spy car on my street bothering me and I just confronted the guy in it, because fuck it.\n\nThere is a Virginia plate on the back of the car but no plate on the front of the car. Virginia TGD-9613. If anyone knows anything about Virginia you need plates on both the front and back by law unless this is some special corporate or government vehicle, which it isn't.\n\nSo I'm not sure why this Virginia car with one tag on it but not the other required tag for the front has been following me around today, but I have footage of the guy inside after I knocked on the window and confronted him and told him to get lost and to call Molly and tell her to piss off.\n\n---\n\nYou have to stop sending low-tier rental spies to bother me, $ZETA. You should be focused on running a real company, not on hiring low-tier, easily burnable rent-a-spy shops. Dumb, dumb, dumb. You're dealing with an individual here who was trained on counterintelligence from a young age. I'd suggest you stop, but you can do what you wish.\n\nIf you want to test me, I know who has been on my property or in my house and I was raised in an intelligence world, so come test me if you want. You can think I'm a challenge, but I've already run counterintelligence on your spies and we can just play this game of spies spying on other spies spying on other spies, but why bother?\n\n---\n\nAnyway, if any New Yorkers see this car or tags around on a Beamer or anything else - Virginia tag TGD-9613 - you're looking at a spy car.

"1878963047710199838","2025-01-14 08:31:14 +08:00","Many people are complaining about the death of CS as a major.\n\nYou can literally just study history, start a blog, charge $20 a month for access, and with just 500 subscribers you're at $20*12*500 = $120k a year. At 1000 subscribers you're at $240k.\n\nYou go around and visit Civil War battlefields and follow around the movements of some colonel in the Union Army. Follow him from Chancellorsville to the Second Bull Run to Antietam.\n\nInterview the park rangers. Nobody interviews park rangers. Park rangers are usually very nice and friendly.\n\nYou do this as an LLC, which means your phone bill, depreciation on your car, etc. are all business expenses.\n\nThe only caveat here is you need to be interesting, or funny, or tell the story in a unique way. You have to give value to your customers.\n\nGet Camping World to give you an RV for you to fart around in and if they sell even 2 incremental RVs they've probably paid back their investment.\n\nYou'll get away with six figures and you'll be your own boss.\n\nYear 2\n\nGo trace around the French and Indian War routes. You'll be around Pittsburgh up to New York which are two of the most underappreciated areas of the country.\n\nNobody knows shit about the French and Indian War. Everybody forgot about it from the two paragraphs they read about it in high school history class.\n\nYou will teach your subscribers all about the French and Indian War.\n\nThere is high asymmetry in the French and Indian War. Nobody covers it. Everybody kinds of knows what it is, but not really.\n\nOld, retired people will love hearing about the French and Indian War.\n\nOld, retired people have money and time. It is a complete mistake to think that old people don't have time. Yes, they don't have as much ""time"" in terms of years but they have plenty of time in hours and days, actually more time than almost anyone.\n\nAgain, highly asymmetric since nobody knows this. Everybody thinks old people have no time but old people have all the time.\n\n---\n\nThere you go. There's your plan.\n\nStop making excuses about why you're depressed about the death of CS.\n\nGo teach old people about the French and Indian War through a subscription blog and videotape yourself learning fun facts from park rangers and walking around historical forts and battlefields.\n\nAll you need is about 500 people to pay you $20 a month as a subscription and you're on par with these CS major salaries for junior employees that seem to be disappearing.\n\nIf you scale this up to 1500 people you're taking home as much as a Director of Product Management.\n\nTry the French and Indian War blog. Don't knock it until you've tried it.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/R5SLBTIGeo"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhNm0BRXsAAuPTB?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GhNm0BRXsAAuPTB?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","null",497,24,356,11,19,67474,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1878963047710199838"

The possibility of high returns incentivizes unestablished actors to accept minimal wages in exchange for roles. With the exception of a few extremely talented actors, producers are unable to evaluate the aptitude of the vast majority of qualified actors due to uncertainty. As a result, some actors give sexual favors to producers to obtain a perceived advantage in the casting; the casting couch functions as a counterpayment that effectively reduces their wages. This creates a conflict of interest in which corrupt producers substitute aptitude (an unquantifiable variable) with sexual activity in their decision-making.\n\nCasting couch economics\n\nhttps://t.co/N5nz58TCQV","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","1886654438380855562","null","null",6,1,2,0,0,3134,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1886655798354341968"

The Middle Kingdom/Zhongguo approach says the geographic Han China is merely the vessel for Greater China.\n\n2. Much of this espionage is not actually carried out by top brass in the CCP nor China's MSS. It's a mistake to view the CCP as a completely unified entity. Like in any country/culture there are many competing factions. One of the biggest issues in China is China's ""capital controls"" system that essentially makes it illegal to invest outside of China over fairly small amounts of money.\n\nSo China's wealthy, most of whom are CCP, have to skirt around the official CCP stance when funneling money abroad. This leads to all sorts of issues with money laundering, cross-border payments, illegal gambling, sex trafficking, you name it.\n\n---\n\nIt's not that all Chinese spies are somehow a function of the MSS (China's rough equivalent to CIA and kind of FBI), it's that many are more equivalent to what we in the West would call private investigators or rent-a-spies, the people you hire to see if your significant other is in fact cheating or if a key employee you want to hire is secretly a drug addict, etc. They are working for various wealthy Chinese who may or may not be representing the stance of the CCP.\n\nIt's much more mob oriented than many Westerners realize.\n\nRussia is very similar, though Russia is essentially a gangster-controlled vassal state of China at this point.\n\nThe biggest thing that would break the levee is loosening capital controls. Capital controls are how Xi asserts power over the upper class of China. The enforcement nozzle gets turned on and off, etc.","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1888216094483136643",46,5,23,0,9,13585,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1888223558616158693"

And it's not even doing a great job and is losing people who have been screwed over.\n\nBecause these sales are basically pure margin for APP, it boosts their EBITDA on this part of the business and revenue but it has nothing to do at all with AXON.\n\nDownload Flip.

Because it's a custom pixel it can hide in some cases where Meta's pixel (much larger, more well known) can be picked up by ad blockers or other filters. Plus, many Shopify brands use the Meta Conversions API as their ""source of truth"" about customers rather than the Meta pixel because the Meta pixel is so blocked. It's important because the Conversions API fires at the point of purchase then ""looks back"" at the customer data, rather than a pixel, which registers earlier in the customer journey at the point of a customer landing on the site.\n\n$APP benefits twice here.\n\nOne, if their pixel is not caught but Meta's pixel is, they can ""front-run"" Meta by quickly firing an ad once a landing page is reached but before a purchase is made, which fires Meta's Conversions API.\n\nTwo, if $APP's customers are lazy and don't remove the pixel even after they may have decided $APP isn't for them, $APP's still on the site and able to get a picture of who is on the site.

Many of these kids were only slightly above average, or if very rich completely average. They all knew exactly what to say, how to say it, which doctors would write up specific diagnoses, which professors would be most amenable...\n\nAt UVA there is a student administered Honor System which is taken very seriously. All students would write and sign their names on every exam:\n\nOn my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment/examination.\n\nI and every other UVA student did this hundreds of times.\n\nYet many students - mostly rich white kids - were pulling a Jose Canseco and juicing. The Honor System became a farce of itself. \n\nThe Honor System is managed by the student-led Honor Committee. These are the most awful, entitled brat wannabe lawyers, some of whom are juicing themselves. I saw several minority students expelled from the University in my tenure there, kicked out by cheaters who were born to wealthy families who knew how to doctor shop and pop pills just like their mothers and fathers.\n\nAlthough I love the University of Virginia and I made many lifelong friends and connections and I actually managed to learn a few things, this ethnically-biased ""Honor"" System of wealthy pill popper students policing poor students who worked harder to get into the school is why I will never give the University of Virginia one red cent of my money as a donation.\n\nThis problem of spoiled people claiming learning disabilities to cheat and get a leg up on poor-but-smarter people has only gotten worse in the last decade.","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1900546509516541975",144,8,57,5,23,49458,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1900916804119138334"

"1900998810089996451","2025-03-16 03:53:29 +08:00","Let's get into how ""cheating the system"" works at top universities.\n\nLet's look at the University of Virginia's Honor Committee right now. 👀 👇\n\nRemember: any UVA student or professor can make a claim against a UVA student and allege that this target student has decried their Honor and cheated, lied, or stolen, thus creating an environment to expel this student.\n\nRemember: many of these Honor Committee members (it's all student-run by design) are competing for the same jobs, internships, graduate school positions as the people they put on trial.\n\nThe umpires are also competing for the same big money jobs and positions. If you're not white, you're fucked.\n\nMany of these Honor Committee kids are from very wealthy families and I personally know some who were on the Adderall pill/extra exam time program at my time at the University from 2009-2013.\n\nIf you're a poor Dominican kid from the Bronx or some Black kid from the boonies in Alabama and you are beating these people in academics and outscoring them on tests, these are the people who will make sure you are put in your place. Seamus and Alexander and Carson will make sure you don't advance.\n\nIf you've had to take out a loan, say $50,000 to cover your studies for 2 years, these fucking people get to decide whether you get to pay back your loan by actually completing your degree.\n\nThese Fucking People™ get to decide whether you stay or go from the University of Virginia. Also, please remember - and this is critical - that these people are also competing with you over a limited number of law school positions, grad school positions, McKinsey/Bain/BCG internships, investment banking jobs, medical school positions.\n\nIf you are Black or Latino or trans or whatever they will fuck you. I saw this happen when I was there several times.\n\nSeamus Oliver will fuck you in your asshole if you are too ""uppity"" and getting too high of test scores that makes him and his pals look bad.\n\nAlexander Church, Carson Breus (a woman with a man's name - classic Southern gentry BS, I know how this game works), Thomas Ackleson...they will all fuck you if you have darker skin than they do or you look different than them and you get too high of test scores.\n\nThey are all playing wannabe lawyer and judge.\n\nThese people will all become dirtbags in life, just like how it was when I was at UVA, just like it was before me, just like how it still is now.\n\nI guarantee you that many of these people on this Honor Committee policing other students are on the pill/extra exam time program. It was like this in the early 2010s when I was at the University of Virginia and this nonsense has only gotten worse in society since then.\n\nThis bullshit is why many in the alumni community do not give to the University of Virginia - you can't have rich, entitled students policing other students and sniping off minority students who are too smart. It's a disgrace and an embarrassment.\n\nThis is why UVA's football field Scott Stadium stays empty and the alumni community - especially among women and people of color - don't want to go back.\n\nI and many other alums will never give a penny to UVA so long as the University allows rich white kids to police all students - but especially minorities - about ""honor"" as they cheat on exams themselves while on pill/extra exam time programs.\n\nThis is pure white supremacy. I've made my opinions on this clear to UVA as they want to shake me down for donations. Get rid of the system of white cheaters policing minority non-cheaters and I'll write you a check and you can name a bench or a building after me.\n\nNot one fucking red cent of my money is ever going to the University of Virginia so long as white bastards like Seamus Oliver and Alexander Church and Carson Breus (again, a woman with a man's name because in the South wealthy firstborn girls are given masculine names) are allowed to police people of color and these bastards have free range to kick out people with darker skin who perform better than they do.\n\nThis is a local problem for UVA, but it's my problem because I went there and I can't comment on other schools, but the same thing exists at many ""top"" schools. It's disgusting. \n\nSeamus Oliver and Alexander Church and Carson Breus can eat my asshole for all I care.\n\nCarson loves sanctioning people. What a fucking cunt. How is that your ""thing"" in life when real people have real problems? She gets fucking moist in her panties ever time a Black guy is put in front of her firing squad at UVA. Go volunteer at a soup kitchen without posting about it on social media if you actually want to make a real difference in life.\n\nOn LinkedIn Carson claims she's going into private equity, so that sounds about exactly right.\n\nThis is why I give nothing to UVA. It's why thousands of others in the UVA alumni community give nothing and it's why the football stadium stays half empty.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/CkjhPT6S5V"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GmGsMXKWsAAvWjB?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GmGsMXKWsAAvWjB?format=png&name=orig""}]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1900952268007936070",105,11,46,3,10,54976,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1900998810089996451"

You can and will find me if you so desire.\n\n2) Take a glove - it can be any glove such as a workman's glove, a lady's glove, a driving glove, your winter glove - and look me in my eye and air your grievances against me and smack me across my face with your glove and demand your satisfaction from me.

We can pick any location. I'd recommend we settle this on the Lawn at Mr. Jefferson's University. It's barely over an hour flight from my home in NYC and if you are mad that I have issues with the University's ""Honor"" System of white kids on the pill/extra exam time program policing minority students not on the pill/extra exam time program then what better a place to settle our differences?\n\n4) I will bring a second. My second and I shall examine the pistols to ensure a fair duel and you of course may bring you own second. I will lean back-to-back against you and then I will proceed 10 paces in your opposite direction before turning to face you.\n\n5) I will then aim my pistol directly at your forehead and I will shoot you in your face. If you've gone through so much effort to find me, to slap me with a glove, and to demand your satisfaction from me then I will not fuck around, no Sir, no Ma'am. I will not fire my pistol into the air after you have gone through all these steps, because clearly you have an issue with me.\n\n6) I will shoot at you and you will die should my bullet pierce your head or should it pierce a critical artery.\n\nI am not fucking around. If you have an issue with me and you want to play 1850s-style honor, then you can easily find me with minimal effort and you may challenge me to a duel and you may demand your satisfaction from me.","[]","laurenbalik","Lauren Balik","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1604570011695136768/cxGsn_qa_normal.jpg","null","null","1900998810089996451",52,1,10,2,9,19412,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/laurenbalik/status/1901211161627926923"
