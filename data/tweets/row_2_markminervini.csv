Since our March 4th STEM downgrade (our stock only Stock Trading Environment Model), the indexes have made little progress. Stocks in general have been mixed. We slowed our roll considerably in February and continue to take a cautious and very selective approach. We already sold most of our positions into strength and de risked the ones we are currently holding. Indexes are still holding intermediate uptrends.

Still holding names that are performing well such as $GDDY, $ABNB, $MSFT, $ALLY, $APO. Some extended stocks have pulled back, but we have yet to see a pick up in volatility to the extent that there's much more than normal portfolio pressure.\nThe market in general has held up quite well. It appears a pullback is occurring in a more rotational manner than an outright broad decline. The indexes have simply marked time over the past few weeks. At the end of February, we bought $MDY and continue to hold the mid-cap proxy. \nToday the Russell 2000 is leading the charge; it also led the advance yesterday.  \nWith some traction we are likely to add more names, but I'm not just charging back into the market aggressively. No different than any other cycle; taking it one stock at a time, building on traction and never digging in with a strong opinion.

It looks like we have entered an overdue shift in price behavior where trading breakouts will be challenging.\nInitial jobless claims are still subdued, close to the pre-pandemic level, and low by historical norms. Wall Street was forecasting that the Fed would start lowering interest rates by March. That never happened and it is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Now some are questioning if rates will start coming down this year!\nWith volatility on the rise, bullish sentiment lofty, and individual stock action suspect, I see no reason to do anything more than play it very cautious for the time being and until conditions improve.\nThe long term trend is up, but a short term a pullback of 4-7% and even up to 10-12% would be normal. A pullback of that magnitude may not happen, but it's overdue. \nWe have not seen a jump of 150% or more on the $VIX since 2006; before that, 1993. In 2006, we headed into a bear market, but 1993 was just a correction/consolidation.\nOur long term $SPY trend model remains bullish and we don't see a major top forming. However, our stock only STEM risk model is at maximum caution. That's pretty much all we need to know for the near term.

The Dow has been the weakest of the major indexes, so we feel we are in the right general market short. With that said, I don't think we are forming a major top, rather a correction withing a bull market. A 5-8% pullback on the $SPY would be normal. The $DIA is already down about 5% from the highs.

The reversal came right on schedule as I warned our members earlier in morning when the averages were gapping up on the open.\nThe Nasdaq Composite closed below the 50-day for the first time since early November of last year, but the market in general has been under distribution for several weeks. Volatility has started to pick up considerably. The VIX closed at 19.23, the highest level since October 2023. Using history as our guide, we are moderately oversold, but there is still room for more volatility. In the near term we could get a bounce, but volatility risk remains elevated. \nRetail sales increased 0.7% in March, more than double the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Additionally, the previous month was revised up to 0.9% from 0.6%, fully erasing the weather-related drop at the start of the year. It confirms the economy has ended Q1 with strong consumer demand, which partly explains elevated inflation.\nReal GDP growth estimates rose to a 2.8% annualized rate from 2.4% previously. Strong growth and relatively high inflation has pushed off market expectations for Fed rate cuts until later this year.\nThe market is adjusting and it's overdue. I think this pullback will lead to a good buying opportunity, likely sometime this year. But for now - while volatility is high -  we are playing defense until conditions improve and we see signs of stabilization.\nhttps://t.co/JXzFFTmMtn","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/IH7BUTyFGn"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLSv4NbXoAA5vd-?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLSv4NbXoAA5vd-?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1007,90,141,6,30,112512,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1780241776302788813"

The market initially jumped following Powell's comment that the next move for the Fed was unlikely to be an interest rate hike. Hopeful bulls took to social media proclaiming ""he's dovish."" \nThe market soon came to grips with reality and the ""no rate hike"" rally quickly faded as most of Powell's remarks were put into perspective with regards to the stickiness of inflation. The Dow reversed, wiping out what was once a 500-point gain.\nPowell has been saying for months that the path of interest rates is going to be ""data dependent."" The official policy release was no surprise as rates were left unchanged however, they did state that ""the committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until is has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%."" Dovish???\nPowell made it clear that the Fed would not act on just a month or two of data, but said a full quarter was more significant. He made it clear that the most recent quarter was hot.\nVolatility around the FOMC is to be expected. But both the Nasdaq and NYSE suffered distribution days on above average volume with a bearish outside day. Given the increase in volatility, distribution and Powell's comments, I remain defensive. \nWe have not reduced or covered our $DIA short initiated on April 5. The long term trend remains intact, but near term, I see a market that is complacent, fragile and likely to undercut the correction low.

"1808598102888362309","2024-07-04 04:26:04 +08:00","Some of my personal views of life, success and the universe. 👇\n· Life isn’t fair, get used to it! But don’t let it make you feel that you have to play unfair. You don’t.\n· Breaking your word and screwing people eventually catches up to you.\n· Drugs destroy dreams and alcohol pickles them. There are much better ways to get high naturally on life.\n· No one builds something great and lasting by chance. Luck is unreliable. Every week someone wins the lottery, but every week the name is different. The harder you work and the better you practice, the luckier you get.\n· Love is your natural state. If you want to change the world, learn to love your enemy.\n· Don’t tell people what to do, inspire them by doing it.\n· First step to getting rich is to go where the money is. The second step is to forget about the money and focus on being the best at what you do. The third step is to create value for humanity.\n· When making big goals, think in decades, not years.\n· Learn how to leverage and duplicate yourself.\n· Only buy highly depreciating assets with 10% of your liquid net worth.\n· Only lend to family and friends what you are willing to give.\n· Always get odds on your money.\n· Consider your savings at zero. No matter what happens… DON’T TOUCH IT! Ask the question: “what would I do if I didn’t have this money?” And then, do that.\n· Ask good questions, you get solutions. Ask bad questions, you get problems and obstacles.\n· What you focus on and think about expands and becomes real.\n· The key to happiness is in the meaning you assign to events, and YOU are in control of that.\n· Choice is the human superpower. Your choices change the world.\n· There are no justified excuses for those who truly take responsibility.\n· What is bad for one human is bad for the human race.\n· There are no justified resentments.\n· A mind is like a book, it’s only good when it’s open.\n· What is most important to you will always win over what you want the most.\n· You can achieve far more than you think you can.\n· If you weren’t an important part of the universe, you wouldn’t be here. You matter.","[]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",2090,425,1214,19,74,253913,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1808598102888362309"

The big money is on the right side, and the bonus is you don’t get murdered or go to jail.\n· The people closest to you could be the poorest sources of advice. Why? Because they care about you, and they want to protect you from failure and disappointment.\n· Smart people avoid people, places and things that weaken them.\n· At the risk of hitting a wrong note or two, sing! Be willing to explore your potential. Don't die with the music inside you.\n· Life is way shorter than you think.\n· If you want to perform like a champion, you must first learn to think like one. To change the printout of the body, you must learn to rewrite the software of the mind.\n· Life is like a radio. All the stations are playing simultaneously; it’s simply a matter of which one you choose to tune into. A way to win and a way to lose always exist as options.\n· It’s not what happens to us that creates our feelings; it’s what we believe about what happens to us—the meaning we assign to an event. Nothing in life has any meaning except the meaning we give it.\n· When we are willing to see that our past isn’t set in stone as if it’s fossilized, we can revise the meaning behind unwanted experiences and free ourselves from the chains of our personal history. You are not your past.\n· Your current circumstances don’t define you; they reveal you.\n· You show me a “good” loser, and I’ll show you someone who makes losing a habit.\n· Our souls are hungry for more than just victory. Our souls are hungry for meaning.\n· If you cling to your old fearful beliefs, you will never be able to courageously create the life you dream of. Instead, you will remain a frightened child in a grown-up world.\n· If you want to improve, each morning, ask: What can I do today to get me closer to my goal? In the evening before bed, ask: What did I learn that I can use tomorrow to move me closer to my goals?\n· You become a winner the instant you decide to start living like a winner; then winning competitions and winning in life become possible. But first you must bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be by living in a new identity.\n· Find the best part of you, and treat yourself as if you are only that.\n· Live as if your prayers have already been answered.\n· If you are not living the life you imagined, it’s because someone or something convinced you that you weren’t smart enough or talented enough and you believed it.\n· Every person who ever accomplished something that was thought to be impossible, simply performed a series of small tasks that were possible.\n· Concealed in every situation we face is a lesson.\n· Go boldly after what you want and expect some setbacks, some disappointments, and some rotten days. Embrace them all as a valuable part of the process and learn to say, “Thank you, teacher.”\n· We will never experience what we’re remotely capable of unless we believe that the heroes we admire are really role models, showing us what’s possible—what we, too, can achieve and exceed.\n· No matter how much talent or natural ability you have, no matter how many hours you practice, if you have a poor self-image you will never reach your full potential, because you can only perform up to your self-image.\n· To improve, the first step is to forget about all the ideas in your head about what is wrong and why you should be doing better. Become interested in what you can learn, and look at your results as a nonjudgmental observer collecting and analyzing data.\n· If you focus too much on how you failed, you will become an expert on failing. If you find yourself dwelling on mistakes or worrying about how you’re going to perform, immediately shift to what you did well in the past and envision yourself being at your best.\n· My definition of commitment is simple: doing the thing you said you were going to do long after the excitement and jubilation you initially felt has faded.\n· When you accept everything on your paths as a necessary part of the process, you stop looking at setbacks and mishaps as reasons to quit, and you start looking at those so-called failures as important steps and exciting opportunities.\n· Those who succeed big at anything all have the same attitude: They keep going until it happens or die trying. Quitting is simply not an option.\n· Knowledge and skill can be acquired through study and practice, but nothing great comes to those who quit.\n· Most people don’t fail because they lack potential; they fail because they lose confidence in their ability and they give up.\n· When you feel like giving up, realize that at that very moment, you are at the same fork in the road that everyone eventually faces. If you quit, you are being just like every other coward who takes the easy way out and chooses to give up.","[]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","1808598102888362309",918,180,584,6,49,127648,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1808927534060339250"
"1809677510441070914","2024-07-07 03:55:15 +08:00","If you want to be a champion, you are going to have to learn to think and act independent of the good opinion of others. And you are going to have to learn to dream big when small men tell you you're just a dreamer.  \nWhen you are full of dreams, passion can lead you to pursue what may appear to be unrealistic goals and do things that no one but you understands, and few people will do. But that is precisely what gives you the opportunity to reach greatness.  Champions are not realistic. They are audacious dreamers who set enormous goals. They’re not worried about setting goals too high; they’re afraid of setting them too low. All great performers have high standards. And almost all of them know the importance of consistently pushing themselves to new levels. Dreaming big doesn’t necessarily mean having more money, more possessions, or winning titles. Maybe your dream is to help end world hunger, or to be an ambassador for world peace, or to simply inspire others by leading an exemplary life. The point is to dream big! What you think is a big dream now, may turn out to be small in hindsight once you achieve it. If that weren’t the case, we would still be in the Stone Age. The number one reason why people don’t succeed in a big way is because it never occurs to them that they can do it. As a result, they never try, or they give up and quit as soon as the going gets tough. Where there’s a lack of dreams, there’s a lack of motivation and progress. Having an unrealistic imagination is the starting point for greatness. If you want to make a contribution to the world, dream big! Encourage your children to dream and fantasize. For as far back as I can remember, I had these wild fantasies and visions of doing and achieving great things in my life. That gave me the motivation and a vision for what I could achieve. When you dream big and follow your passion, you begin to do new and different things, gradually at first, until the whole direction of your life changes. In the beginning, our dreams always feel so immense. We wonder how we’re ever going to achieve them. We think about the enormity of the task ahead of us. But little by little, you make progress. One achievement here and another there add up over time. And eventually, those wins start to stack up, one by one. This builds momentum, moving you closer to your goals. By being willing to set an unrealistic goal, you instantly have an advantage over 99 percent of everyone else, because few are willing to think big and attempt great things. You realize that there’s a long road ahead, but you’re also willing to do what it takes to get there, and that is what makes you a winner.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/mOyjnb4g81"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GR1D1-FX0AAZK87?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GR1D1-FX0AAZK87?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",632,86,160,10,35,149237,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1809677510441070914"

They would like to win, but they also want to avoid being embarrassed or finishing last. So they trade off not finishing last for not finishing first. Champions think differently. \nSports psychologist Bob Rotella said, “If you hate three-putting and your ultimate goal is to avoid making three putts, you’ll two putt your life away.”\n\nCHAMPIONS HAVE A SELECTIVE MEMORY\nWhile self-reflection is helpful, dwelling on your problems, past mistakes, and misfortunes only magnifies negative emotions and engrains bad experiences. \nPerhaps you replay a poor performance over and over in your head, and each time you envision it, you beat yourself up. As you rehash those painful times, your self-confidence plummets and hopelessness soars. It’s very common for people to relive negative experiences. This is how negative expectancy is created—but not by elite performers! \nChampions know that mentally replaying the same scene over and over increases the chances of reexperiencing it in real life. Winners choose to remember their successes and conveniently\n“forget” their failures.\nThat doesn't mean we don't learn from our failures. To the contrary, winners embrace failures as valuable lessons. But they don't dwell on them. The focus always shifts to solutions.  \nhttps://t.co/6cailGmUk4","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/gRMZPCLYNQ"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTWF6LwW0AEC8WX?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTWF6LwW0AEC8WX?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",357,50,79,5,18,46678,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1816506042202853858"

Before the Crash of 87, traders thought the decline had washed itself out on Friday 10/16/87.  On Monday 10/19/87, the Dow fell 22% in a single day. Some stocks have already suffered bear market percentage declines. \nTraders are now pricing in a 60% chance of an emergency Fed rate cut within the next week. Goldman economists raised their odds for a US recession in the next year to 25% from 15%.\nThe real issue is volatility. Even if the a market low is established, wild swings and whipsaw action is an environment for the brave, not to prudent. \nWe think this decline will create a good buying opportunity this year. However, I am not the least bit interested in trying to pick a bottom. Instead, I'll wait for stabilization and proper setups from low risk entry points. In the meantime, I'm enjoying the show with no longs, lots of cash, and some light short positions going into today. https://t.co/JXzFFTmMtn","[]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","1819099660838953229",1863,208,291,33,60,253559,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1820471731804364998"

Volatility is likely to remain elevated, and short term counter trend rallies are where institutions will trim risk into.\nWith the exception of a couple shorts, going into yesterday we were all cash; no longs. \nThe most durable sign that a reliable bottom has been formed is stock setups working from breakout levels.

The popular averages closed in the middle of the day's range on lower volume. The Russell 2000 was the strongest closing up +1.23%. The ""rally"" looked more like a dead cat bounce than a strong start to a new sustainable up leg.\nGiven the size and speed of the decline over the last few days, there is undoubtedly some trapped supply out there. At the very least, we are likely to experience more volatility, something I avoid like the plague. Until the market stabilizes and setups start to emerge, I'm pretty much sidelined. For how long?  As long as it takes; could be days, could be weeks.\nIt has been 12 months since the Fed last raised rates, longer than the median eight months. The Fed is now preparing the markets for a September rate cut, indicated by changes in their statement acknowledging that job growth had “moderated” and the unemployment rate had “moved up.” \nFed Chair Powell mentioned a September rate cut is “on the table” if recent data trends continue, but he dismissed speculation of a 50-basis point cut. The July employment report was surprisingly soft, paving the way for a potentially more aggressive Fed.

There is no guesswork in our trading, just rules and the discipline to follow them.\nA couple of our recent buys and largest positions include $ONON and $META. We are still short $SCHW from July.\nhttps://t.co/JXzFFTnkiV","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/oUOGz5yuHk"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GVmQDSjWkAA74X8?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GVmQDSjWkAA74X8?format=png&name=orig""}]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",873,88,168,14,27,100688,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1826649539568435328"

"1827404038843113521","2024-08-25 01:54:09 +08:00","Mail in ballots were originally intended for military persons. It was during the Civil War that America first experimented with absentee voting on a large scale, as so many of the men who were eligible to vote were away from home fighting. \nPresident Lincoln wanted to assure that he got the votes of the soldiers who were serving away from home. Aside from that, up until the late 1970's, those who voted by mail generally had to have a specific reason (like sicknesses) for not being able to vote in person on Election Day.  That began to change in 1978, when California became the first state to allow voters to apply for an absentee ballot without having to provide an excuse. \nI find it statistically strange that there is such a huge proportional difference between the two parties; literally inverse (see chart below). I am not implying the the 2020 election was rigged or stolen. But I also think it is very naive to think that if a loophole to cheat was available, either party wouldn't cease the opportunity. There's cheating in sports, business and pretty much everything. The US Presidency is the most powerful position on planet earth. Politics is the hardest hitting competition on earth. We should assume that both sides will cheat if given the opportunity. And that's why we should close all avenues as best we can to mitigate the cheating and its statistical significance. \nThere's a very easy way to ensure a fair election. GO BACK TO BASICS! \nUS citizens must show up with a valid ID in person, or be a military person unable to vote due to their duties. Exceptions could also be made for extreme circumstances like serious illness. Computers can be hacked. This is a case where keeping it simple is the best solution.\nWhat is your feeling about this subject???","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/YOmLZT5oXf"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GVw-SgUXMAAdGQo?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GVw-SgUXMAAdGQo?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",767,62,54,9,165,92296,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1827404038843113521"

Longer term, the trend is intact, but with each pullback it's getting closer to being challenged. Not to be confused with my individual stock trading, our long term $SPY model (which is purely mechanical) is still holding its Jan 13, 2023 buy signal. It would take more downside action to cause the model to start raising cash. The question is: do we consolidate and rally, or is there more downside in store?

My concern is a potential ""sell the news"" situation. In 2000-2002, the Fed cut rates from 6.5% to 1%. The S&P 500 fell 51%. In 2007-2009, the Fed cut from 5.25% to 0%. The S&P 500 fell 57%. \nWith that in mind, I'm keeping one foot close to the door with a tight leash on my open positions. \nWith core inflation coming in slightly higher than expected, odds of a 50 basis point cut are probably slipping away.

"1851353935459619022","2024-10-30 04:02:29 +08:00","Our work suggests the bull market is intact. Our own trend model is still holding its January 13, 2023 buy signal; the $SPY would need to decline fairly significantly for it to move to an outright sell signal. Sentiment is on the frothy side, so there is some elevated risk for a pullback, possibly if election results were accurately discounted and we get a sell the news event. Still, election year and seasonal/cycle work points to a rally into year end, so pullbacks should be buyable. The environment for trading individual stocks (particularly from base breakouts) has been plentiful with a good number of buyable setups. The problem has been elevated volatility around breakout levels and a lack of powerful follow through. If you are using tight stops, you've probably been whipsawed. Those adjusting for volatility, possibly using an ATR approach, have likely fared better than those keeping a tight leash on their stops. Earnings season is also fueling volatility and overnight risk. A year end rally is probable. Going forward, the key for a healthy trading environment will rest on participation; if the small and mid caps can join the party in earnest, we may experience a pleasant holiday season. The VIX coming down would be a welcome development, and could be a harbinger of a high alpha low/standard deviation rally. The kind we love. Rates backed up a bit, but that's better than if they plummeted, because the latter would suggest a weak economy and a higher probability for a recession. Of course, you should always be prepared for the opposite side of the trade. Mind your stops, and remain disciplined. \nhttps://t.co/JXzFFTmMtn","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/xmeGeV2FtR"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbFQ1kLXUAACi_3?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbFQ1kLXUAACi_3?format=png&name=orig""}]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1334,159,336,11,35,90828,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1851353935459619022"

Today's pullback is emblematic of the tricky market environment. A good number of breakouts have worked, but the cost has been elevated volatility. For a true ""easy dollar"" environment to unfold, we need to see volatility come down and a broadening of participation. Unfortunately, today is a step in the wrong direction as far as volatility is concerned. \nI think until we see a convincing breakout from the IBD 50 and improved participation from mid caps, we will be facing a challenging environment.\nThe tricky part to this market has been how individual stocks have acted following breakouts. We have seen volatility around pivots points; stocks try to breakout but can't follow through much except for those heading right into earnings, which entails overnight risk.\nShort term, the market got a bit frothy. A longer term sign of froth is the US global share of the marketplace. The last time the US market had a market cap share relative to the rest of the world like it does now was just ahead of the tech bust. But money always finds a home and that creates opportunity. \nWhen I first started trading, the Dow was only a little above 1,000. At the time, everyone thought the market was ""high."" Years later they said the same thing when the Dow hit 5,000, then 10,000, 20,000, and now it's over 40,000. When the Dow is at 100,000, you will hear the same refrain from the pessimists. \nWe will have pullbacks, corrections and even bear markets, but for those who are disciplined and apply sound rules, the future is bright. But only if you are smart enough to respect risk!\nShort term I'm cautious. But I'm looking for a buying opportunity on pullbacks for a probable year end rally. However, I will NOT get aggressive without a proliferation of breakouts and traction in the form of follow through from breakout levels.\nhttps://t.co/JXzFFTmMtn","[]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1283,123,270,9,30,86033,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1852045845253812290"

Other than the Nasdaq Composite, all the major averages are trading below their 50-day moving average lines. Breadth and participation have been weak, and the high relative strength stocks have recently come under selling pressure.\nThere continues to be a lot of ""crowding"" in some of the mega cap names, which have held up pretty well relative to the general market.

There's still too much complacency in the market, in my opinion. \nWhen the market first comes under distribution and there are few stock setups, we look to sell rallies.

Yields on benchmark 10-year climbed Monday to 4.8%, rallying more than a percentage-point since mid-September.\nUntil we see meaningful accumulation in the averages with no immediate distribution and a wave of new setups in buyable position, we view rallies as nothing more than technical bounces during a correction.\nI have not yet covered my $SPY short position initiated on 12/9. \nhttps://t.co/JXzFFTnkiV","[]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1410,130,161,20,62,151632,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1879230863646613897"

The probability of buying additional shares is greater for shares that have lost value than it is for shares that have gained value.

That doesn’t mean that all your ideas and actions will always produce the desired results. At times, you will feel that success is unattainable. You may even feel like giving up. I know. I’ve been there. I went six consecutive years without making a penny while pursuing stock trading. \nAlong the way, I had days when I felt so demoralized by my unsatisfactory results that I almost threw in the towel and gave up. However, I knew the power of persistence. Then, after more than a decade of trial and error, I was making more money in a single week than I dreamed of making in a year. I experienced what the English poet and playwright Robert Browning meant when he wrote, “A minute’s success pays the failure of years.” \nRemember, if you choose not to take risks, to play it safe, you will never know what it feels like to accomplish your dreams. Go boldly after what you want and expect some setbacks, some disappointments, and some rotten days. Embrace them all as a valuable part of the process and learn to say, “Thank you, teacher.” \nBe happy, feel appreciative, and celebrate when you win. Don’t look back with regrets at failures. The past cannot be changed, only learned from. Most important, never let rotten days make you give up.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/520vmYnfBG"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gi5YuiWWsAAvofK?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gi5YuiWWsAAvofK?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1403,190,380,20,60,120806,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1886542853117038953"

Up to that day, I had not only never played or practiced with these guys, I never even met them.  So, the question I have been asked over and over is, ""How did you play so tight with them and perform like you've been playing together for years?"" The answer is what I talk about in my book Mindset Secrets for Winning, which is visualization and mental reversal. I indeed DID rehearse with this band, but they didn't know about it. I did it in my mind!  By the time I got on stage, I had already been there and worked out all my parts on the drums. All the band had to do was be professional and play their parts correctly as they normally do, which they did, and I am thankful for.  The mind is very powerful and can work for you when you know how to program it and allow your subconscious creativity to run free and tap into the champion inside of YOU. \nIf you want to improve the way you think, read my mindset book. The principles changed my life and many others around the world. I'm confident it will be the best $29 you ever spent. \n😇🙏 👇\nhttps://t.co/tLyswHwaJM","[]","markminervini","Mark Minervini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1537118279667425281/0AxLCNg4_normal.jpg","null","null","null",576,22,51,1,32,57567,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/markminervini/status/1897370618452172911"

With that said, cycle work shows a strong tendency to rally starting sometime in April/May. We are likely looking at a cyclical decline within an on-going secular bull market.  However, every bear market starts as a pullback, and when the warning signs are present, I treat a pullback as a potential bear market and step aside until the smoke clears. The biggest warning sign currently is the way individual stocks are behaving and the distribution dominate tape we are seeing. Enjoy the video.

Volume was well above average while this market has still not been able to bounce for any longer than one single session with distribution dominating the action.\n\nA proliferation of pivot failures and clear distribution in the indexes forced us to high levels of cash, and we also shorted the $SPY just 3 days off the all-time high. As the selling intensified, our long term SPY model started raising some cash as well.\n\nThis morning I covered half my $SPY short initiated on 2/24 at a 7R profit.  \n\nI think there's a chance that we melt down further from here, but our work suggest this is a cyclical correction within an on-going secular bull market. With that said, it is likely to take some time for stocks to build bases and reliable low risk setups to develop. \n\nThe market indexes are deeply oversold which could certainly produce a strong snap back rally as some of the biggest up days occur during bear market and large corrections. But keep in mind, a market that fails to rally from an oversold condition is a weak market prone to volatility. Risk is high, which means cash is king!\n\nCycle work points to the start of a rally in April.
