If they offer you mentorship or feedback, it is extremely valuable\n- Always uphold the golden rule – always make your boss look good. It’s not because it’s your job to burnish their reputation, but because if you think about how your work impacts their work and position, you have a greater chance of developing the sort of self-awareness needed to advance in an organization\n- Everyone suffers setbacks.

One of my favorite interview questions is “what’s the most expensive thing you’ve broken?”\n- I know a lot of successful people. Some are brilliant, some are rich, and some are very good looking. All of them have cultivated the ability to persist through substantial discomfort, and to never give up. Conversely I know plenty of otherwise talented people who folded like a house of cards at their first major setback and have yet to achieve anything like their potential. \n- Another way to improve resilience is to deliberately and consciously set yourself challenging tasks, and then retrospectively grade your performance\n- Spend time around people who get bruised for fun","[]","buccocapital","BuccoCapital Bloke","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1563293153498607616/mxXlhN0z_normal.jpg","null","null","null",526,29,587,2,7,62801,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/buccocapital/status/1888342436478357866"

It speaks to what will be valuable in an AI-denominated future: yes, the real world and human-denominated industries will rise in economic value, but so will the tools and infrastructure that both drive original research and discoveries, and the mechanisms to price it.""\n\n2. @anecdotal: ""in the AGI era, the only defensible reason for universities to remain in operation is to offer students an opportunity to learn from faculty whose expertise surpasses current AI. Nothing else makes sense...\n\nUniversities will retain faculty in three categories: those advancing original research beyond AGI capabilities, those who teach the use of advanced equipment and sophisticated physical skills, and those handling previously undiscovered source materials or developing novel interpretations that outstrip AGI’s analysis. \n\nIn the sciences, this means laboratory-based faculty who validate AGI-generated research proposals and offer advanced hands-on training with advanced equipment. In engineering and the arts, it’s faculty who guide students in high-level physical manipulation, augmented by AI tools. \n\nIn the humanities, it’s scholars working with newly discovered primary sources, untranslated manuscripts, or archaeological evidence not yet processed by AI, as well as those creating fundamentally new interpretive frameworks that transcend AGI’s pattern-recognition capacities.\n\nThe curriculum narrows dramatically. Most lecture courses disappear. What remains are advanced research seminars where faculty share findings from new source materials or original experiments, intensive laboratory and studio sessions for hands-on skills, and research validation practicums where students learn to test AGI hypotheses. This represents a 60-70% reduction in current faculty positions, with remaining roles requiring fundamentally different capabilities than traditional academic work.","[]","buccocapital","BuccoCapital Bloke","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1563293153498607616/mxXlhN0z_normal.jpg","null","null","null",780,61,1003,15,53,119162,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/buccocapital/status/1889020292686553329"

First, I used O1 Pro to build me a prompt for Deep Research to do Deep Research on Deep Research prompting. It read all the blogs and literature on best practices and gave me a thorough report. \n\n2. Then I asked for this to be turned into a prompt template for Deep Research. I've added it below. This routinely creates 3-5 page prompts that are generating 60-100 page, very thorough reports\n\n3. Now when I use O1 Pro to write prompts, I'll write all my thoughts out and ask it to turn it into a prompt using the best practices below:\n______\nPlease build a prompt using the following guidelines:\n\nDefine the Objective: \n- Clearly state the main research question or task.\n- Specify the desired outcome (e.g., detailed analysis, comparison, recommendations).\n\nGather Context and Background:\n- Include all relevant background information, definitions, and data.\n- Specify any boundaries (e.g., scope, timeframes, geographic limits).\n\nUse Specific and Clear Language:\n- Provide precise wording and define key terms.\n- Avoid vague or ambiguous language.\n\nProvide Step-by-Step Guidance:\n- Break the task into sequential steps or sub-tasks.\n- Organize instructions using bullet points or numbered lists.\n\nSpecify the Desired Output Format:\n- Describe how the final answer should be organized (e.g., report format, headings, bullet points, citations).\nInclude any specific formatting requirements.\n\nBalance Detail with Flexibility:\n- Offer sufficient detail to guide the response while allowing room for creative elaboration.\n- Avoid over-constraining the prompt to enable exploration of relevant nuances.\n\nIncorporate Iterative Refinement:\n- Build in a process to test the prompt and refine it based on initial outputs.\n- Allow for follow-up instructions to adjust or expand the response as needed.\n\nApply Proven Techniques:\n- Use methods such as chain-of-thought prompting (e.g., “think step by step”) for complex tasks.\n- Encourage the AI to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps.\n\nSet a Role or Perspective:\n- Assign a specific role (e.g., “act as a market analyst” or “assume the perspective of a historian”) to tailor the tone and depth of the analysis.\n\nAvoid Overloading the Prompt:\n- Focus on one primary objective or break multiple questions into separate parts.\n- Prevent overwhelming the prompt with too many distinct questions.\n\nRequest Justification and References:\n- Instruct the AI to support its claims with evidence or to reference sources where possible.\n- Enhance the credibility and verifiability of the response.\n\nReview and Edit Thoroughly:\n- Ensure the final prompt is clear, logically organized, and complete.\n- Remove any ambiguous or redundant instructions.","[]","buccocapital","BuccoCapital Bloke","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1563293153498607616/mxXlhN0z_normal.jpg","null","null","null",4561,325,14128,71,65,694523,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/buccocapital/status/1890745551995424987"

"1891563806729625883","2025-02-18 03:02:09 +08:00","This is the type of advice that sounds correct and insightful but is often incorrect for some reasons that are really important to understand: \n\nThe primary one is that a career is not a public equity. Your talent doesn't get priced by the minute, hour, or even by the year. Some people get antsy and force a pricing event. That's often the right short-term move and it feels good. But it can hurt your long-term value by limiting your experience, severing the performance feedback loop, leaving when you are on the cusp of promotion, forcing you to re-start your internal network, and more\n\n(Obvious caveats that people always complain about. Yes startups move faster. Yes some roles can build big things in under two years. Yes you had a shitty boss who didn't promote you. Yes some companies don't value internal talent)\n\n1) Outside of a few roles, it's really hard have a large impact in less than two years. Even more so if you're in management or the company is bigger. People will complain at this, say ""skill issue"", etc, but it's true. It just is. Maybe that project wasn't as big or long-lasting as you thought it was.\n\n2) People who job hop don't get to see how things break. There's tremendous value in seeing how things scale, and then don't. What broke? How? Was it avoidable? How do you fix it? Iterate? Start from scratch? You lose that experience when you job hop \n\n3) For most big, impactful projects, getting things done requires a dense network of people across the organization. It can take a while to build that network, and your impact will be limited before you have it. Every time you move you reset to zero \n\n4) Similarly it takes time to establish authority and trust. Organizations, and knowledge work in general, require these to have an impact\n\n5) Compensation isn't linear. So you might spend 2-3 years building toward a promotion, or establishing the trust required to be deserving of equity\n\n6) Similarly, your resume is a ""trust battery"" that can either charge or deplete. Strong brands establish trust in the market. Getting promoted repeatedly at one place establishes trust in the market. Not being a job hopper establishes trust in the market. Making those investments early on will generate large returns over time \n\nAll this to say...if you're actually talented and are just getting 2-3% salary increases and when you get promoted are getting a 5-10% bump. Change jobs. Your company doesn't respect internal talent.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/UIiIgSmhcz"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GkArG1zWkAA6h9I?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GkArG1zWkAA6h9I?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","buccocapital","BuccoCapital Bloke","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1563293153498607616/mxXlhN0z_normal.jpg","null","null","null",312,11,159,2,20,46340,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/buccocapital/status/1891563806729625883"

Stock’s down 8% post-earnings—because why? Tariffs? Softness in China? Here’s the deal: this is exactly why I hate earnings season. It’s just people firing off these ridiculous hot takes, praying they get picked up by some aggregator because apparently the short-term narrative matters way more than anything real. Can we at least agree that’s annoying? And look, I’m not anti-paying attention to earnings, but when you start pretending Nvidia isn’t absolutely torching the AI market right now, I just—I don’t know, man. Also, can we talk about Jensen Huang’s leather jacket for a second? Have you seen that thing? Leather jackets are impossible to pull off—I’ve tried, believe me, I’ve tried, and every single time I end up looking like a guy who panicked last-minute before a Tinder date. I can’t pull it off. I wish I could, I really do. But Jensen strolls up in the leather jacket, absolutely dominating a room, with like 300 direct reports behind him—and nobody even blinks. And we’re worried about a couple months of softness in China? Seriously? Let’s not pretend Jensen’s jacket doesn’t matter more than some quarterly guidance. Everybody relax. Jensen’s jacket is fine. Nvidia’s fine.

But I was watching his interview  on Sunday and reading his Truth Social posts and I mean, you look at the comments, about not ruling out a recession and his obsession with the 10 year and it’s just, like, are we really doing this? We’re going to do the whole South American authoritarian austerity thing? Like we’re some petrostate with 40% inflation? And so yeah if you squint at it it’s like maybe - but then you really look into it & you’re like “wait….what?” This administration’s Big Three is a guy wearing eye liner, Little Marco Rubio and Elon Musk on ketamine? And how much of this is that he saw a Mercator projection of Greenland and thinks it’s huge. And that it’s green? And wouldn’t it be funny if Canada was a state. And doesn’t know that we demilitarized Japan. So like, do I think he can do a hard landing and rise from the ashes like the 2011 Mavericks? Yeah, sure, maybe. But when you start talking about all these different potential speed bumps, you know, especially with a foreign policy of demanding Thank You's, the snip snap on the tariffs, and the numbers QQQ has put up the last two months and god knows that used to be good for +2% a month for 15 years it’s kinda hard to buy into the story because Trump just has such poor ability to articulate the long-term strategy into how we pull this tariff thing off.  And then we’re comparing against these different situations some involving the nuclear codes, truly life or death situations for our nation, global hegemony on the line, like, what are we even doing?
