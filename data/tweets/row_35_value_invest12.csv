Their chancellor candidate Merz, famous for his anti-AFD firewall stance will now have only one option:\nA coalition with both, SPD & the Green party, both of which have unanimously rejected Merz’ proposal for a change in immigration policy. \n\nThis is a disaster in the making for both Merz and Germany. Essentially the new government would be even less stable than the prior Ampel coalition which was the most disliked in Germanys recent history. \n\nFrankly, this scenario would make me extremely bearish on Germany and also Europe. \n\nHowever, I see a small glimmer of hope. Given that the situation is as impossible as it is, the alternative that had been ruled out becomes more attractive: A coalition between CDU/CSU and AfD (20.7%) would be strongly aligned in terms of immigration and economic policy. \n\nThis could not happen under Merz, as he tied his persona to the firewall. However, I expect pressure on Merz will get very strong as he won’t be able to form acceptable coalition compromises. Not acceptable for his election promises, not acceptable for SPD and Greens, and not acceptable for German voters. \n\nThis moment will offer a window of opportunity for Markus Söder from CDU/CSU to become Chancellor by tearing down the firewall and form a coalition with AFD. Söder can be described as extremely power hungry and opportunistic. Characteristics that will be required to tear down the firewall and build the coalition Germany needs. \n\nBelow a picture of Söder with Vance at the Munich Security Conference. Personally, I like Söder a lot as a politician and I believe he is much more aligned with the unwokening of the US than Merz. Without doubt, this turn of events would also be a chance to save US/Germany relationship which Merz has to my shock absolutely buried in todays post election interview.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/wwbMOBQpMa"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GkghItTW0AA2F77?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GkghItTW0AA2F77?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","value_invest12","Value Investigator","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/932305474673954816/ztJ_7VKt_normal.jpg","null","null","null",25,4,7,0,4,7406,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/value_invest12/status/1893800081507090826"

And they have now seen the even more left communists “Linke” landing a surprise success with 8.7%.

An uprising of the base and the deputies is thus unlikely to take place for the time being.\n\nBut, big BUT:\n\nAll Merz announcements are linguistically so softened that not much of them will remain.\n\n1. ""Rejection of ALL on the first day"" becomes ""rejection in consultation with European partners by all means of the rule of law, including asylum applications."" Means: Germany will only do what the EU allows and what is supported by neighboring countries. Will Merz thus, as promised, instruct the BMI to reject all illegal migrants at all borders? No.\n\n2. Illegal migration should no longer be ""ended"", but ""effectively pushed back"".\n\n3. What really happens can be read in the family reunification. It is suspended ONLY for persons entitled to subsidiary protection and only ""for a limited time"". That's 12,000 out of about 130,000 per year. Where it can be measured with hard numbers, the ""asylum term"" means: ten percent less migration, the rest may expressly come further.\n\n4. Gross defeat for the Union in citizenship. The new law of the SPD and the Greens should remain explicit, the German passport will continue to be smed on the fast track.\n\n5. For inexplicable reasons, 25,000 migrants per year are still allowed to enter Germany from the Western Balkans (instead of the previous 50,000). Again in hard numbers: Where you could easily reduce by one hundred percent, you reduce by 50 percent.\n\n6. According to the wording, rejections at the border of asylum seekers are only possible if Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, etc. agree.\n\nCONCLUSION: Maybe it was no longer in it (and in the coalition negotiations this is diluted even further), but this has very little to do with the ""unnegotiable"" conditions of Friedrich Merz.\n\nFORECAST: Illegal migration will continue, reduced by approx. 25 percent.","[]","value_invest12","Value Investigator","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/932305474673954816/ztJ_7VKt_normal.jpg","1898441660062699851","null","null",5,0,0,0,1,1972,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/value_invest12/status/1898441799456448626"
