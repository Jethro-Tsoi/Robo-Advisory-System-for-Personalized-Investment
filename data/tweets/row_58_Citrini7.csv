"1830942394654613940","2024-09-03 20:14:18 +08:00","Part of what we discussed in the GLP-1 primer ~13months ago was the reflexive nature of a genuinely successful weight loss drug.\n\nWe covered the idea of virality (boosted by social media) but also the concept of the devastating health effects of obesity and how this would likely be reported in mainstream media in a manner that would make GLP-1s seem like a “miracle drug”. \n\nGLP-1s can potentially cure / lower the risk of nearly everything, as long as the mechanism of doing so is “you were more prone to those bad things happening because you were fat and now that you’re less fat they are less likely to happen”.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of stuff we’re finding out that GLP-1 drugs do that might work even if you’re not overweight, but 90% of the articles and data is driven by the weight normalization. Fertility? Yeah. Heart disease? You bet. Cancer? Yep.\n\nA good example of this, in the extreme sense, would be a headline like:\n\n“Ozempic cures death.”\n\nAnd then the article explains that Ozempic reduces all-cause mortality in a specific cohort. Because being obese is likely to be the reason you eventually die.\n\nPeople currently don’t realize exactly how significant of a reason it is, even if they think they do. And that was a big part of the NVO/LLY bull thesis - realizing this would result in a relentless march of positive data received well by the market. It has been one of the few places in biopharma where you could be 99% confident all of these trials (heart disease, OSA, etc ad nauseum) would meet their primary endpoint.","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","null",118,8,30,1,9,19742,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1830942394654613940"

I mean…\n\nif one of you said to me, entirely matter of fact, that something I was bearish on was a screaming buy likely trading at 2-3x 5yr fwd EPS, I might not enjoy the interaction…\n\nbut blocking would never even cross my mind. tbh, if you ended up being right a year later i’d put notifications on for your posts to ensure i get a better understanding of why my thinking was incorrect.\n\nsocial media has given us unprecedented access to alternative opinions. anon finance twitter is the closest thing we have to an entirely merit based forum for idea exchange. i can say without a doubt: using it as such has improved my own process.\n\nwhat they don’t tell you about risk management: it has just as much to do with risk metrics and portfolio construction as it does graceful recognition of being wrong & action orientation in fixing it.\n\nyou cannot quantify stubbornness or egotism (maybe you can, idk, i’m terrible at math), but you can train yourself to recognize when you’re ignoring salient points that don’t conform to your current view.\n\nif you’re serious about long term outperformance, eventually you’ll discover you need to incorporate the views of others into your process. even if it’s to know when to ignore them. \n\nwith those people, you don’t ever care about how they make you feel, just that they make you money.\n\ni follow a fair share of people on here that i don’t, uh…like. if i had the misfortune of meeting them in person i’d find an excuse to be somewhere else asap. \n\nbut they have views that are either nuanced, differentiated, more specialized or flat out better than my own in their respective fields. people that aren’t just contrarian for the sake of being contrarian*\n\ni’ll never block them. they make a fool out of me when I’m wrong? great - better here than in the order book.\n\nif you’re serious about not getting your face ripped off by risks you’re willfully blind to, i’d reccomend doing the same. \n\npeople who disagree with you (respectfully if possible, but - if they’re *really* good - disrespectfully can be worked with) should be overrepresented in your rolodex. \n\nsee how you feel after a discussion with them. if you are on to something good, you’ll leave feeling more conviction. \n\nthe best investments I have ever made all have in common early conversation(s) with someone intelligent on the opposite side that left me thinking “wow, if *they* don’t get it then there’s no way the market does yet. i should size up”. \n\nif at any point during the exchange I feel like they’re making better points than I am, I know the thesis isn’t “the one” and my time is better spent elsewhere.\n\nno matter what, the market will make you face doubts at some point, better to be prepared for it.","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","1849920517345824846",491,24,228,11,30,119750,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1850027731682984091"

Jose de la Vega, a Spanish trader & moral philosopher during the South Sea Bubble in Amsterdam’s exchange published it in 1688.\n\nIt describes options, buying on margin, market manipulation and, most interestingly, market psychology.\n\nDespite being the first book to explain a stock exchange, it was relatively unknown until an essay was published about it in the late 19th century. \n\nWhile a first edition from 1688 sold at auction for $300,000, if you’re lucky you can find facsimile copies from the late 19th/early 20th century - limited runs that likely were owned for the same reason you will - a trader thought it was cool. \n\nThis copy is from the 1920s.

IWM gained 35% from nov ‘16 to nov ‘17. \n\ni don’t know if that repeats itself but if I think that beta alone can have me up +30% from here in just a year from now, well…\n\nbet your ass I’m willing to give up more than a little of that. as long as it means I don’t end up shaken out of a massive trend for some stupid little macro or earnings overreaction. as long as I have the capital to buy the dip when the long side becomes so crowded that any incrementally not great news is likely to be perceived as a massive negative catalyst…i can content myself with giving up quite a bit of it.\n\nthe second pic below shows my performance as I gave up -5.6% vs SPY from May to July, overpaying for hedges that became worthless. \n\ni’d do the same thing over again because when they didn’t go to zero, they & other negative theta/positive vega macro trades were the only reason I was able to buy the dip aggressively in my highest conviction areas like VRT and medtech/healthcare on august 5th. i still ended up selling down some AI exposure, but not nearly as much as I would have if I didn’t have some cover. \n\ndid it suck to be down in Q2 while mega cap tech ripped despite being bullish on AI myself? yeah. of course it did.\n\nbut it paid off because i didn’t let myself get caught offsides. instead, i got to bust out the shopping list on names in a long term thematic (healthcare’s cyclical inflection) basket that are up 39% collectively since.\n\nunless you’re content to buy and not look at the screen again for a decade, part of a long term view is making sure you have the psychological wherewithal to withstand underperformance despite conviction when the cause is unrelated to your thesis. \n\ni’ll take sideways for 6 weeks while everything rips 10% over down 20% when everything drops all day, everyday. especially if it means I get to be the bidder of last resort when there’s a firesale in obviously inflecting names.\n\nall I’m saying is: if you’re killing it right now, it is probably time. it’s time to hedge yourself so you are comfortable enough to ride late cycle beta (which is, subjectively speaking, the best beta).\n\ngive up some of it proactively so you don’t give up a lot of it reactively.\n\ndon’t be the guy that panic sold SPX 3200 Sep-Oct 2020 and never got the chance to get back in at those prices. don’t be the guy that spends the rest of the cycle looking for reasons to be correct in hindsight while everything he once owned makes new all time highs.\n\nbeta that doesn’t go down as much as the market during drawdowns IS alpha.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/20KLnU8xw9"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZxWAAAUHZX?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZxWAAAUHZX?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/20KLnU8xw9"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZyXEAAkuck?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZyXEAAkuck?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/20KLnU8xw9"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZxWkAAPKrW?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZxWkAAPKrW?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/20KLnU8xw9"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZvXYAA2eDQ?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GcKW-ZvXYAA2eDQ?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1048,71,501,17,53,231018,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1856212000461774979"

And you you are not omniscient, you will be wrong very often and very frequently. \n\nLegendary investors (Soros, Druck etc) will be the first to tell you that they didn’t become legends by being correct all the time. Many of them have been wrong far more often than they’ve been right, you’re no different. Soros had a hit rate between 30-50% by contemporary accounts.\n\nSo we’ve established - no matter what you’re going to take losses. The game of risk management means you have to find a way to reconcile your inherent & inevitable wrongness with your desire to make money over time.\n\nIn those precious few moments when you are really, truly and objectively right - you better be making bank. “Taking profits” on your single position solely because that single position has worked only ensures you don’t go broke if a) you never make another trade again and b) you have no losses that position needs to make up for.\n\nMake no mistake - I’m not saying it’s wrong to take profits. But the idea that it’s never wrong to do so is deeply misleading. You can and will go broke taking profits if those profits don’t more than make up for the losses.\n\nDon’t truncate the right tail - make your winners pay for your losers and then some. When you’re right, size tf up. And when you think you might be wrong, gtfo. \n\nJust make sure you don’t end up rationalizing the flawed habit of exiting perfectly good, money making positions just because it represents an unrealized gain and you feel safer realizing it. Don’t go broke taking profits.","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","1857491927739863292",520,51,182,9,38,97609,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1857495096792399965"

"1861427397637067027","2024-11-26 23:10:49 +08:00","this was too harsh. the reaction is not silly and dumb. but imo it is not an accurate representation of where value can be accrued in the GLP-1 space currently. \n\nAMG-133 probably will have worse side effects. Especially at higher doses I imagine the n/v will be worse than semaglutide.\n\nThe thing is though, some patients don’t experience n/v with GLP-1s at all. And I think the more I look at it the more I see the case for GIPR antagonism to result in more sustainable weight loss that lacks a significantly pronounced and immediate rebound effect. I also think it’s quite possible that AMG-133 does not have plateau as soon as TZP and Sema, which (on a patient by patient basis) is extremely important. If you have a patient that needs to lose 50% of their body weight or find their way to a guaranteed early grave, you are kind of screwed right now if they just stop losing weight at -20% on either TZP or Sema. \n\nAMG-133 seems like it can be commercialized. Maybe it ends up being that this is the one that’s preferred for longer term significant weight loss in the morbidly obese population. \n\nThere are tradeoffs in every drug. The market is looking at this situation like it is a race to get the best drug for every single outcome. That’s not the case. \n\nThe most accurate example I can come up with here is Lipitor. Atvorstatin was a huge winner and, for a while, the only winner in the statin space. Market reactions clung to data on lipid profile alone. But what they missed was that the opportunity was not in cloning lipitor but in the niches.\n\nRosuvastatin & Pravastatin are examples of this. Lipitor skyrocketed because it was the most efficacious, but some others either worked in the cases where lipitor didn’t or the cases where liver was a concern.\n\nAnyway, “silly and dumb” was my own overreaction. I will rephrase:\n\nThe AMGN reaction makes AMGN long quite asymmetric from here.","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","1861420236395753596",56,5,21,1,6,26194,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1861427397637067027"

It’s stupid. \n\nMy $365,000 investment in SMCI made me a little more than $3m. Meanwhile, the friend I discussed in the quoted tweet now has a lifetime pnl on SMCI that is, somehow, negative. \n\nWe had the same thesis. We agreed on everything. We were both very early.\n\nIf he’d just bought shares when we first discussed it (January 13th 23) AND COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN TO SELL ANYTHING…he’d be up 335%. \n\nHuge drawdown, potential delisting, accounting fraud…whatever. He could have parked money in there, literally forgotten he owned it, come back this morning and sold and had a quadruple plus some despite all of it. \n\nInstead, he’s lost money, time and probably hair. \n\nI’m not speaking harshly of him, he agrees this was what he should have done. We all make mistakes and he’ll learn from this one. But maybe, if you’re in that situation, you can too…\n\nIf you’re someone who is making an effort to manage your own money and trying to compound it effectively for retirement, never touch options. Just don’t, whatever justification you have is wrong.\n\nYou want to hedge? Cool, sell stock.\n\nYou want convexity to a ripping trend? Buy higher beta stocks. \n\nYou want income? Buy bonds.\n\nSelling options for income as a retail trader is the stupidest thing imaginable. It’s like working a job but every day you roll a d100 to find out if your boss murders you. \n\nIf your goal is to invest your own money and aim to compound it slightly better than the market for retirement then *take this advice*.","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","1758498183032832168",1110,106,504,22,97,331852,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1861852941147148580"

I don’t believe the boost from deregulation would offset this, and I believe history would support that. \n\nEssentially, once the market realizes that Trump *could* be serious about cutting the deficit (through what I am sure will be many different proposed changes), it will become the market’s responsibility to throw a fit when it is discussed. Because that’s how you discourage Trump from actually pushing forward on it, you send the Dow down every time it’s mentioned.\n\nIf any of your are doubting whether the next few months will have the highest probability of every Trump proposal being taken seriously, the last 5 hours of the news cycle have been dedicated to whether America can fight a two-front war to annex Greenland. \n\nSo…yeah.

I had my EMT certification, but in LA the only thing you can do with that is basically be a dialysis taxi driver. I did that, because I needed the money, but it was a soul crushing job.\n\nTo make more than minimum wage you needed to 1) be a paramedic and/or 2) work for a fire department. For all of its amazing qualities, the LAFD was pretty insular. It was difficult to get a foot in the door. \n\nHaving come from the northeast, where more than half of the EMS was volunteer, I looked for opportunities to get this foothold by volunteering. \n\n@PasadenaFD was the only Fire Department in the county I found with an EMS volunteer service, the EMSR. I volunteered for them while I was doing an accelerated medic course. \n\nWhile I ultimately left the profession, I will never forget how kind Pasadena FD was to me. It was amazing and educational (and you got to go to the Rose Bowl for free, with hopefully only the occasional interruption from someone with heat exhaustion). \n\nI met some amazing people at that station, the volunteers also were the most selfless people you’d ever want to know. I know every single one of them is out there right now, doing anything that’s needed of them. \n\nBelow are just a few charities that can help them do that and rebuild after.","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","null",450,26,33,2,13,40213,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1877606730856558644"

"1884051345348370895","2025-01-28 09:30:19 +08:00","This is the best thing CitriniResearch has ever done.\n\nOn Friday at 6:52AM, we published a note to our chat detailing our take on the implications of deepseek for the AI trade. Our conclusion was to go long Phase 2 (software/agentic AI enablers) and short SMH. \n\nWe spent the day going through our AI basket with a fine tooth comb. What could stay in if funded by short SMH, what needed to be added, what absolutely had to go. \n\nFour minutes before the market closed on Friday, at 3:56pm, we published our finalized updated AI basket.\n\nOur changes were drastic.\n\nOur new additions: the AI basket was now ~50% short $SMH and long a collection of those Phase 2 software names - most of which closed green today. \n\nAdditionally, we expanded our deletions of data center buildout names despite already having deleted NVDA a month ago. \n\nWithout our community, we might have felt pressured to wait until we had an in depth piece filled with our analysis to pair with these changes, but we gave our subscribers a heads up and they gave us the all clear. Unlike previous updates, we felt enough urgency to release our trades first before the market closed and then release our analysis over the weekend. \n\nMyself, @rennyzucker and @nicholastreece worked through the weekend to prepare that analysis in a way that accurately communicated a nuanced take while not slighting our high conviction. \n\nOn Sunday, we released our analysis. The conclusion: the intricacies aside, the market would take deepseek as extremely bearish for Phase 1 and generally bullish for Phase 2. \n\nWithin 12 hours, it was the most viewed article in our entire archive. \n\nToday, the CitriniResearch AI basket was down 14bps. \n\nif we had not made these changes, it would have been down more than 7%. \n\nA huge thanks to everyone involved in this, I have never been more proud of our work, our team and our collective dedication to keeping our readers informed as to actionable and timely insights. 🥂","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/fvjZdfxp2S"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmNWsAAgHxo?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmNWsAAgHxo?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/fvjZdfxp2S"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmOWgAA7w9y?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmOWgAA7w9y?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/fvjZdfxp2S"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmMXMAA63Jv?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmMXMAA63Jv?format=jpg&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/fvjZdfxp2S"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmKXwAA_Ped?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GiV-tmKXwAA_Ped?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","null",1129,47,375,19,56,242543,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1884051345348370895"

"1890158185287180563","2025-02-14 05:56:43 +08:00","I still do not think there’s an actual trade to be had here yet, but I posted this short memo a while back on the idea of “Strategy” ($MSTR) losing its premium to BTC another way instead of via BTC sentiment getting worse: via supply of “BTC Reserve” copycats increasing. \n\nGoing to put it on twitter since we’ve just seen some confirmation of its potential merits with GME this afternoon doing what I anticipated it would.\n\nOriginally posted 11/24/2024 to CitriniResearch:\n\n“There are two ways the premium placed on MSTR equity relative to its bitcoin holdings resolves and narrows again.\n\n1) The first, as everyone knows by now, is a decline in the price of bitcoin reducing the willingness of participants to pay that premium. Supply stays the same or goes up (depending on Saylor’s willingness to issue equity while the premium declines) while demand goes down. This is a pretty easy play if you were convinced of it, plenty of expressions: short MSTR standalone, short MSTR vs BTC long (beta adjusted or not), short levered MSTR etf vs MSTR…et cetera…\n\nBut let’s say bitcoin keeps going up. Is there any way the premium narrows then? That brings us to number 2…\n\n2) The second is a bit more nuanced. It requires understanding that Microstrategy does in fact have a uniqueness to its financial engineering wizardry that makes the premium phenomenon durable. This is self-evident - if it were not the case and the premium was solely a function of investors looking for bitcoin exposure you’d have seen it narrow or at least stop widening after the Bitcoin ETFs. The uniqueness is a function of a few things:\n\na) MSTR shares are fully marginable with all prime brokers - not currently the case for Bitcoin ETFs\nb) MSTR is able to tap capital markets to borrow (to buy more bitcoin) and can issue equity at a premium (to buy more bitcoin). As long as the shares trade at a premium, this model works great. Akin to shorting one dollar and being able to go buy $3 with the proceeds. \n\nTherefore, if we aren’t looking at the demand side of the equation as we were in the first example, we have to look at the supply side. But MSTR is unique on 2a&b, so essentially you’d need to increase the supply of a unique value. Right? Well, maybe not.\n\nThe only thing that makes 2b unique is that other companies have not really embraced the concept of holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, nor have they done so via borrowing and issuing equity as blatantly as MSTR has. But that doesn’t mean they won’t.\n\nTake, for example, SMLR. SMLR is basically microstrategy, just later. Relatively stable underlying business where the CEO has decided to spice things up by putting bitcoin on the balance sheet. I don’t think they’ll be the last to do so either. \n\nWhile I cant endorse going long SMLR and short MSTR, I do think a trade similar to this will arise soon and we’ll be able to go long a basket of these new Microstrategies following the “Macrostrategy” playbook Saylor has invented. Might be worthwhile to consider the companies that could do this in the future. \n\nHonestly, GME could do this easily.\n\nAnyway, just some sunday musings. No actionable trade here - the last time I touched MSTR was to go long the converts in Jan 23 (which ended up 60x-ing, although I made less than that due to my inability to sit on it!). I don’t plan on trying to fight the trend here, there are easier ways to make money. But I figured I’d share this thought today if, at the least, to elevate the discourse around it.”","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","null",301,24,134,3,18,46773,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1890158185287180563"

My two biggest risks, from where I stood, were a momentum factor unwind and a reacceleration of inflation. If momentum unwound, China - with its historically low valuations and general levels of uninterest by investors - would likely get a bid. If China’s economy began recovering, the “immaculate disinflation” we had been experiencing would likely face headwinds.”\n\nThe first part has played out. Nasdaq has gone down while China goes up. \n\nWhat’s the current macro view on whether that second part ends up playing out? Is the Chinese recovery & stimulus effort a threat for higher inflation in the U.S. (despite weakening)?\n\nI managed to avoid making a fool of myself in 2022 by not calling for stagflation, but it does kind of lurk there in the tail.","[]","Citrini7","Citrini","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1875761503686582272/VhlaZoEp_normal.jpg","null","null","1785994214280413367",189,4,74,0,21,51822,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/Citrini7/status/1901444011283370039"
