FWIW, this is ""unprecedented"" in the data series, including 1999-2000.","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/1enWJxgD7P"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTWwPigXcAARDPb?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTWwPigXcAARDPb?format=png&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/1enWJxgD7P"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTW1430XEAA-hxe?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTW1430XEAA-hxe?format=png&name=orig""},{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/1enWJxgD7P"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTW2BQAXkAEnYUn?format=png&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTW2BQAXkAEnYUn?format=png&name=orig""}]","profplum99","Michael Green","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1489248051810095105/38yzwTTp_normal.jpg","null","null","null",23,0,13,1,2,20685,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1816562506896408670"

"1833885620269420862","2024-09-11 23:09:38 +08:00","A fascinating, even if somewhat wrong, thread.\n\nFirst, the error.\n\nWho pays is not as simple as presented here. The China manufacturer may normally want a 40% gross margin, but the tariffs have just raised the cost of a China-sourced suit by $61. Remember China’s sole value-added in this suit is $10 of labor. If Bangladesh can make this same suit with $30 in labor, then the Chinese mfr has to accept a lower margin. Landed cost is now $275 from Bangladesh vs $302.50 from China (w/Tariffs). So China mfr must price at $220 to be competitive w/25% tariff ($275/1.25) lowering their gross margin to 34.1%.\n\nBut they’ve now shifted from a $242 vs $275 advantage to being par with Bangladesh, so volume likely falls, reducing fixed cost absorption.\n\nLikewise, the end price of the suit has still risen as $275 marked up 150% is $687.50 vs $605. As Derek has noted, clothing demand is highly price elastic, meaning quantity demanded will fall sharply with a 13% price increase. So the clothing retailer in the U.S. is going to have lower margins (unless a monopolist). Let’s guess that the retailer takes the same 10% margin hit as manufacturer to prevent demand collapse. Then the markup on $275 is 127% for a retail price of $625 vs $605.\n\nSo retail price rises by 3.3% and China profits, especially after calculating share loss to Bangladesh, fall by a giant amount.\n\nStill think the U.S. consumer pays?","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/RCS1eizIpn"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXNFPoiakAEuD2_?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GXNFPoiakAEuD2_?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","profplum99","Michael Green","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1489248051810095105/38yzwTTp_normal.jpg","null","null","1833725667554607176",178,23,84,7,27,55755,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1833885620269420862"

Nor is inflation a solution. Note that he emphasizes NOMINAL GDP growth and tax policy.\n\nThe decrease in Debt/GDP from WW2 was a function of real growth and higher taxes. Same solution we used for debts from Civil War and Revolutionary War. The ""war"" on a housing collapse and a virus are no different (except how badly we fought them). Inflation can camouflage, but it does not ""solve"" high Debt/GDP and it is not a policy objective.\n\nThe trope that every civilization has used inflation to extricate itself from debt is untrue. Civilizations collapsed because they lost taxing authority, which, in turn, led to hyperinflation and a ""new civilization"" -- typically with civil war and unbelievable hardship in the interim.\n\nPaul proposes minor changes to tax policy that stabilize Debt/GDP.

For the most part, it is a genuine attempt to understand by genuinely interested investors.\n\nI am the Chief Strategist of a firm that provides both active and ""passive"" (systematic index investing since there are no ""passive"" products -- it's a lie that's been sold) products. I don't agree with every product we offer and have been transparent both internally and externally where I have concerns. In aggregate, I am incredibly proud of the work we do.\n\nMy research on passive is widely available, and I share it generously. I am always willing to defend my position with data and analysis. I do not gain financially if my concerns are realized. In fact, like most of you, I will be measurably worse off if I'm right.\n\nWhen someone like Ben Felix is willing to genuinely review the arguments, they inevitably reach the same conclusion.\n\nIn contrast, passive proponents like Rick Ferri refuse to even have a discussion because it would harm their business to be shown lacking in substance.\n\nFor those who have not followed my recommendations, this is what I advise:\n\n1. Larger cash holdings are required to provide internal liquidity for larger funds. It is a disaster waiting to happen when firms rely on market liquidity at the scale of Vanguard. Read the prospectuses. Vanguard is utilizing more and more derivatives to facilitate its growth.\n\n2. There should not be PREFERENTIAL treatment of quantitative strategies – no “index returns” or backtest exceptions for index products. Backtests presume that the strategy does not affect the market it trades. This was why I was able to predict the implosion of XIV and I'm assuring you the situation for the broader stockmarket is much, much worse.\n\n3. Enforce diversification rules! Funds like Vanguard's S&P500 Growth fund are in violation of the 1940 Act for diversified funds and are only able to marketed to retail because Vanguard has lobbied for exceptions.\n\n3. The industry has become monopolistic due to failure to enforce existing regulations. “Bundling” in retirement plans, QDIAs (qualified default investment alternatives), and fees charged to fund managers by platforms like Fidelity raise the cost to consumers and reduce your choices. I want to preserve the benefits of passive investing for smaller investors who should not be expected to ""Do your own work"" while recognizing that there is harm created when it is pushed to current scale.\n\n4. Open market buyback operations and accelerated share repurchases were banned pre-1982 to prevent stock market manipulation. In a market made increasingly inelastic by passive investing strategies, they simply enrich the executives at the largest firms. A good whitepaper on the subject can be found here: https://t.co/FfxRqA6Qjr ... id=4851266\n\n5. Markets are NOT designed to “deliver” retirements; by linking the two we have bound policy (eg the Fed) to bail out markets.\n\nThanks for considering my work. I wish you the best.","[]","profplum99","Michael Green","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1489248051810095105/38yzwTTp_normal.jpg","1853866851723608498","null","null",142,13,51,2,8,18202,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1853866854604804195"

Major win for the West, regardless of the other implications. Will Putin break the ceasefire? Why? He was just promoted from junior partner with China to senior partner European branch. Not managing partner, but a strong voice at the table and a requirement to take him seriously.\n\nWe'll have to see the terms, but imho this is a hugely positive development in both strategic and economic terms.

Ship building in the U.S. was high cost and the U.S. represented less than 5% of global shipbuilding in 1939.\n\nThe VAST majority of U.S. ship building capacity is dedicated to repair and service of existing ships. That is a high cost, labor intensive effort.  New ship building? Well don’t take my word for it…\n\n“Relatively speaking, new construction is a repetitive process to a large degree. Overhaul and conversion work is seldom if ever repetitive. Even among ships of the same class receiving identical alterations, the work requirements will vary, sometimes to a remarkable extent.” https://t.co/XE3aJBNnXN\n\nNote the date (1964). Debates about US ship building capacity have existed for well over 150 years as the article highlights. I am among the first to highlight risks of reliance on China, but the much bigger risk here is an absurd allocation of labor and capital to build a maritime force we simply don’t need YET.","[]","profplum99","Michael Green","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1489248051810095105/38yzwTTp_normal.jpg","null","null","1899638045474713873",189,23,46,2,22,108456,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1899797901779329233"
