Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which pushes up the funds' existing positions resulting in realized returns. We decompose fund returns into a price pressure (self-inflated) and a fundamental component and show that when allocating capital across funds, investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are self-inflated or fundamental. Because investors chase self-inflated fund returns at a high frequency, even short-lived impact meaningfully affects fund flows at longer time scales. The combination of price impact and return chasing causes an endogenous feedback loop and a reallocation of wealth to early fund investors, which unravels once the price pressure reverts. We find that flows chasing self-inflated returns predict bubbles in ETFs and their subsequent crashes, and lead to a daily wealth reallocation of 500 Million from ETFs alone. We provide a simple regulatory reporting measure -- fund illiquidity -- which captures a fund's potential for self-inflated returns.\n\nhttps://t.co/j54HqKzUGb","[]","MebFaber","Meb Faber","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1616559057984421888/JA46l4Zy_normal.jpg","1823408199242014894","null","null",2,0,4,0,1,5024,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/MebFaber/status/1825975511564300592"

The Impact of Private Equity Investments on Soccer Clubs""\n\nAbstract\nThis study investigates the impact of private equity on European football, focusing on the 96 male teams (67 female teams we have data on) in the five principal European soccer leagues-Premier League (Super League) (England), La Liga (Liga F) (Spain), Bundesliga (Frauen-Bundesliga) (Germany), Serie A (Serie A Women) (Italy), and Ligue 1 (Feminine Division 1) (France), and the 2,178 male soccer players in these 96 teams and the 1,645 female soccer players in these 67 teams as of the 2023-2024 season. Using a staggered difference-in-differences methodology and both hand-collected and private datasets on soccer clubs' financials, male player salaries, male and female player and match performance statistics, and team and sponsorship changes, the paper examines PE's impact across three dimensions - managerial, financial, and male and female player and match performance. The findings suggest that while PE investments may have successfully boosted commercial aspects, such as revenues, on-field individual soccer player performance declines (mostly that of individual female soccer players) as well as team match performance (mostly observed in both female and male away games). This discrepancy highlights a trade-off where off-field gains haven't translated into on-field success. This suggests that soccer clubs move through a transition period and a strategic shift (as evidenced by immediate chairman, management, and squad changes). Despite male players' salary increases following PE investments, reflecting PE's alignment with strategic goals, individual player and match performance suffers because of team dynamics changes. We document that degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality among players decline following the PE deal, which has a direct impact on home and away match performance.\n\nhttps://t.co/qdqnLLHII0","[]","MebFaber","Meb Faber","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1616559057984421888/JA46l4Zy_normal.jpg","null","null","null",11,2,4,2,2,7534,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/MebFaber/status/1831062433005441531"

With valuations in certain sectors low and profitability high, share repurchases have risen sharply. 60% of European companies are now buying back shares compared to around 20% historically. This buyback bonanza is concentrated in Financials and Energy, and in both cases the combination of dividends and buybacks mean investors in these sectors are seeing cash returned to them worth around 9-10% market cap per annum.

The current tax code does not allow the deductibility of financial advisory fees, which means that a 1% fee is a pre-tax expense to the client. E.g., $10,000 is paid on $1mm SMA is $10,000 out the door. \n\nETF solution: Fees are tax-deductible. Management fees in an ETF can be netted against dividends, interest, and income, implicitly making them tax-deductible. The deduction’s value will range depending on the situation, but at a minimum, the after-tax fee for HNW clients will likely be 25%-30%+ cheaper than an SMA equivalent. E.g., $10,000 might only be $7,000 on an after-tax basis, or a 30% cheaper after-tax fee than the SMA equivalent after-tax fee., $10,000 (1-t) on a $1mm, where t = the blended tax rate on the dividends, interest, and income received in the ETF wrapper.\n\nhttps://t.co/g5e7we8wSb","[]","MebFaber","Meb Faber","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1616559057984421888/JA46l4Zy_normal.jpg","null","null","null",104,16,68,1,11,24535,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/MebFaber/status/1834617243986198637"

Before, it was 50/50 on whether you were better off in global or US equities. After it’s been more than 80/20 in favour of the latter. And worth saying that this kind of persistence of outperformance is not like flipping a coin whereby you might have had nine heads in a row, but the odds of another on your tenth toss are still 50/50. Imbalances build up in these relative stock returns, and in my view the risk of them tipping over is elevated.""\n\n@ManGroup \n\nhttps://t.co/eCpvR1I0oZ","[{""type"":""photo"",""url"":""https://t.co/P3hfne18QN"",""thumbnail"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbU_jFYa4AAcuii?format=jpg&name=thumb"",""original"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbU_jFYa4AAcuii?format=jpg&name=orig""}]","MebFaber","Meb Faber","https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1616559057984421888/JA46l4Zy_normal.jpg","null","null","null",16,4,4,1,5,8870,false,false,false,"https://twitter.com/MebFaber/status/1852456769265778975"

Hedge fund managers take 3% to 4% annually.[2] I estimate that large endowments, with 60%-plus in alts, incur a total operating cost of at least 3% per year.\n\nNow hear this:A 3% expense ratio for a diversified portfolio operating in competitive markets is an impossible burden.
