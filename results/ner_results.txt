Markets have been volatile, initially starting 2023 bullishly before tumbling in response to recent Federal Reserve movements and statements.Investors would not be unwise to at least ponder transitioning away from stocks and toward cash.This could be rewarding, but it also comes with risks of its own.For some investors, this transition may make sense, but for others the best move might be to diversify further.

Badger Meter continues to grow, and most of its bottom line figures have been faring well despite economic concerns.The firm's balance sheet is solid, and management has demonstrated time and again that the business is a high-quality operator.But shares are pricey and likely have limited upside, if any, at this point in time.
J&J Snack Foods has moved lower recently, in spite of sales climbing and because of a worsening on its bottom line.The space the company operates in is large and growing, but this and the lower share price don't make it a good prospect.Given how pricey the shares are, the firm may have additional downside before it's worth considering.
Apogee Enterprises continues to post attractive sales, profit, and cash flow growth.It's unclear what the picture holds for the business, but the overall picture looks positive for shareholders at the moment.Given how cheap shares are, additional upside from here is likely warranted.
HNI Corporation has not had a great year or so, with shares of the business falling slightly more than the broader market has.This may signal to some investors that fundamentals are deteriorating, but that's not exactly the case.For the most part, HNI stock looks to be in decent shape, and shares look cheap.
The management team at General Electric provided investors with a detailed update regarding the company's health and expectations moving forward.The future looks bright, particularly when it comes to the firm's GE Aerospace unit, with plenty of fuel to push sales, profits, and cash flows higher.All things considered, investors should view these developments in a very positive light.
National Presto Industries had something of a mixed year in 2022, with sales ultimately falling, but the second half of the year showing some bright spots.The firm's balance sheet is robust, and the long-term outlook for the business will likely be positive.But given how shares are priced, there are better prospects that can be had on the market today.
Patterson Companies has had a rather mixed operating history in recent years, with sales climbing, but profits and cash flows posting volatile results.That trend has continued into the 2023 fiscal year, though cash flow data is looking up.The firm may not be the greatest prospect on the market, but it does seem to offer some upside based on how shares are priced today.
H&E Equipment Services has done incredibly well at growing both its top and bottom lines in recent quarters.Acquisitions and strong demand have been the key drivers here, and shares have done well in response.Add on how cheap shares are, and I believe that further upside is warranted from here.
BWX Technologies has done well from a sales perspective, but bottom line results have been under pressure.Even with this being the case, guidance for 2023 is encouraging, but this doesn't make the company a great prospect.Shares have done well, but upside is limited from here based on how shares are priced today.
ThredUp announced financial results covering the fourth quarter of the company's 2022 fiscal year that exceeded expectations.This, combined with strong guidance for 2023, sent TDUP shares roaring higher after months of declines.This is great to see and the company is doing better than in the past, but it's not exactly a great prospect right now.
Tennant Company posted some strong sales, profit, and cash flow results recently.The firm expects continued growth through 2023, which should make shares a bit cheaper.TNC stock looks fairly valued compared to similar firms, but it's cheap enough on an absolute basis to warrant further upside.
Vishay Precision Group has done well over the past couple of years, with sales, profits, and cash flows finally rising after years of mixed results.The near-term outlook for the company also looks positive based on sales expectations for the first quarter of this year.Shares are also on the cheap side of the spectrum and, as a result, likely have some upside potential.
Superior Industries International has seen a meteoric rise in recent months, with multiple contributors to its upside.Fundamentally, the company looks to be doing quite well and management seems to expect that to continue.Add on top of this how cheap shares are and the prospect of a buyout, and upside still exists moving forward.
At first glance, Hovnanian Enterprises looks like a dirt-cheap business that has tremendous upside potential.In the long run, the company might very well be fine, but it has a large amount of debt and is seeing signs of additional pain around the corner.Investors would be wise to approach this prospect with caution until we see the depths of this downturn.
RBC Bearings continues to show strong growth, both because of its major acquisition and due to organic strength.Long term, the company should fare well for its investors, but RBC stock isn't necessarily a great prospect.As things stand, it's a neutral play in my book because of how shares are priced.
The past several months have not been kind to Global Industrial Company and its investors, with shares tanking compared to the market.This seems to be due to pain on the firm's top and bottom lines in the second half of the year, and because of general concerns about the economy.Despite the pain, pain that is likely to continue near term, shares are looking attractive and probably do have some upside from here.
Dorman Products has had something of a lumpy operating history, but sales have done incredibly well in recent years.Current guidance is very bullish and could lead to some upside, but it's still too early to know if the company can deliver on it.At present, DORM shares look to be more or less fairly valued and likely have less upside as a result.
Petco Health and Wellness Company has not fared all that well compared to the broader market.This comes even as sales continue to climb and as bottom line results are mixed but still positive.Shares are cheap and do seem to offer attractive upside from here.
Marine Products Corporation has had a great run over the past several months, with shares rising nicely due to robust financial performance.All of the data provided by the company so far indicates little to no real weakness on the horizon.Though shares are lofty compared to similar firms, they do still seem to offer some upside from here.
The management team at Acushnet Holdings continues to post strong financial results for the company, both on its top and bottom lines.The future for the business also looks bright, with sales, profits, and cash flow likely to rise this year.Shares are also priced low enough to warrant additional upside from here despite rising so much already.
MillerKnoll has not been treated kindly by the market as of late, with shares falling due to concerns about the future.Near term, the company may see some weakness, but recent financial performance has been solid and shares are cheap.Ultimately, this makes the firm a good prospect for value-oriented investors to consider.
Limoneira Company's fundamental picture is showing signs of improvement, with top line and bottom line results getting better.The firm is also working to pay down debt through asset sales and transitioning toward an asset-light business model.While LMNR stock is far from being a great prospect, it is better than it was only in the middle of last year.
Civeo Corporation took a beating after announcing mixed financial results and forecasting a weak 2023 fiscal year.It's not surprising that shares of the firm would fall in response to this, but the market isn't valuing the company appropriately.Shares offer additional upside from here so long as operations don't worsen materially moving forward.
Boot Barn Holdings has had a great couple of months, with rising sales pushing shares higher.The firm has faced continued pressure on its bottom line, but the overall picture for the firm is still appealing.Add in that shares are still attractively priced, and it's likely that the firm can still move higher from here.
Atrion Corporation has done well from a sales perspective very recently, but its overall financial performance in recent years has been disappointing.This is especially true of bottom line results that have shown no real growth.The firm is a stable operator that should be fine in the long run, but the stock is pricey for a company with limited growth.
DICK'S Sporting Goods has had some mixed results as of late, though an increase in guidance sent shares of the business higher.Fundamentally speaking, the business looks solid, though we could see some weakness at some point due to continued economic uncertainty.Given how cheap shares are, though, it seems as though the company has additional upside to offer investors right now.
The management team at Stitch Fix is expected to report financial results covering the second quarter of the company's 2023 fiscal year soon.Heading into earnings, analysts seem quite bearish, but so does management.Investors need to pay attention not only to headline news but also to the firm's deteriorating cash position.A cautious approach to the company during this time may not be a bad idea, though it may offer a nice upside if signs of a turnaround emerge.
OneWater Marine continues to grow sales nicely, though the firm has shown some weakness and indicated that some future weakness lies ahead.This may discourage some investors, but the company's overall financial condition looks solid.The stock is also incredibly cheap and likely offers tremendous upside from here.
P.A.M. Transportation Services is far from a great company, but continued growth has been encouraging.Unfortunately, the business is seeing some weakness across the board, and that is likely to continue.But given how cheap shares are, overall optimism is warranted at this time.
Lindblad Expeditions Holdings does continue to recover, but the bottom line results remain under pressure.It doesn't help that Lindblad has a great deal of debt on hand, but it is also true that the business is growing at a nice clip.All things considered, LIND stock could offer upside, but investors should approach the business with caution.
Kontoor Brands had a great run higher after management announced financial results covering the final quarter of the company's 2022 fiscal year.Sales and profits both exceeded expectations and management provided positive guidance for 2023.Though the easy money has been made, KTB shares still look attractively priced right now.
After a couple of great years caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Service Corporation International is seeing its financial performance pull back some.This may be disappointing to some investors, but the company remains a quality enterprise and its long-term picture should be positive.Shares aren't the cheapest, but they do likely offer some upside from here.
The past few quarters have not been particularly great for Netgear, Inc. and its shareholders, with sales, profits, and cash flows falling.The 2022 fiscal year was quite bad for the business, but one part of Netgear does continue to grow at a nice clip.Long term, the picture for Netgear, Inc. is likely to be fine and the firm has plenty of cash on hand to survive this downturn.
Lazydays Holdings has seen a significant decline in sales as of late, with market demand for RVs plummeting after years of strength.The firm also seems to have excess supply on hand, which could create additional pain moving forward.Add on top of this its hefty debt load, and it wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea for investors to turn cautious on the firm.
Graco has had a nice spurt of growth in the past couple of years, with sales, profits, and cash flows climbing higher.The firm's balance sheet also looks solid and its long-term picture is promising.But shares are a bit too lofty to warrant a significant amount of enthusiasm.
Medical Properties Trust was hit hard the other day due to reduced expectations regarding the 2023 fiscal year.Though disappointing, this does nothing to change the fact that shares look very cheap right now.The firm may not be as attractive as I previously thought, but its low valuation and continued improvements justify upside moving forward.
Jacobs Solutions has done quite well for itself in recent years, with its transformation yielding positive results.Strong backlog should push sales, profits, and cash flows higher moving forward as well.Shares aren't the cheapest, but they do seem to have some upside potential to them.
Rent the Runway continues to post strong sales growth, thanks to a rise in the number of subscribers year-over-year.Bottom line results are also improving, but they are far away from where they need to be.For now, I believe there are better prospects to be had, but the firm could eventually grow into its valuation.
Topgolf Callaway Brands continues to grow nicely on both its top and bottom lines.That trend is set to continue and the market has responded positively to this.Shares still look attractively-undervalued, but they aren't as appealing as they were during my previous coverage though, in part due to recent upside.
Installed Building Products has had a great run in recent months, with shares roaring higher due to strong sales, profit, and cash flow growth.Shares look quite cheap right now and are fairly cheap compared to similar firms.Given changes in the space and because of the share price move higher, a more cautious approach to the business would not be unwise.
Commercial Vehicle Group has a history of mixed but generally positive financial results.Recently, bottom line results have come under pressure, but this is normal for the company.Shares look cheap enough on an absolute basis to likely have some upside potential associated with it.

The Bank of Nova Scotia's share price dropped significantly after releasing first quarter results.While it has near-term headwinds, the long-term growth thesis should be intact.With the dividend yield now comfortably above 6% again, long-term investors could see potentially strong returns from here.

3M is now trading at a very low valuation and pays a historically high dividend yield.The less-than-impressive guidance and litigation overhang appear to be more than baked into the share price.It's investing in high-growth areas, and patient value and income investors could see potential strong long-term returns.
Enbridge's utilization levels remain high, with records set in natural gas delivery and the Mainline liquids pipeline running at full capacity.It has an impressive slate of renewable projects including hydrogen and its recent acquisition of Tri Global Energy.ENB has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years, and the recent sell-off presents a great opportunity for income and value investors.

The YTM (yield to maturity) on B. Riley baby bonds has increased as much as 44% in just the last 3 weeks with YTMs up to 12.96%.A short attack (IMO without merit) caused RILY stock to drop but strangely the much safer baby bonds dropped much more. Thus, this excellent buying opportunity now exists.The 12.5+% YTM on RILY baby bonds versus the 8% current yield on RILY preferred stocks is one of the most egregious relative mispricing that I have ever seen.RILY could have a strong first quarter giving investors in their baby bonds a catalyst for a strong rally.

NYCB has treaded water since our last article.The stock faces a huge hurdle from the current yield curve and the bond market has still not figured out that rates will be higher for longer.Margins should get crushed in 2023 and beyond.

Calibre Mining is one of the best-performing gold miners this year, up 18% year-to-date vs. a negative return for the Gold Juniors Index.I attribute this outperformance to the sharp decline the stock suffered in October 2022 (US-Nicaragua expanded sanctions) where it's currently playing catch-up from and solid execution in 2022.Looking ahead to 2023, Calibre will be one of the sector's better production growth stories (~20% growth) and expects to achieve this growth with higher margins year-over-year.From a big-picture standpoint, Calibre is firing on all cylinders and remains a solid growth story, but I can't rule out a deeper retracement and I don't see enough of a margin of safety just yet at US$0.77.

Wheaton Precious Metals is one of the best-performing miners this year, up 4% vs. a 5% decline in the GDX, likely attributed to minimal margin compression relative to producers.While the company's Q4 & FY2022 results were softer than expected, this was partially because of the sale of two assets (KH/Yauliyacu) and the closure of two other assets (777/Stratoni).Fortunately, Wheaton has a solid 2023 and 2024 ahead, with the potential for slight gold-equivalent ounce growth in FY2023 and significant growth in FY2024.So, for investors looking for a steady growth story with industry-leading margins, I see WPM as a name worth monitoring for potential new purchases if we see a pullback closer to $36.00.

Royal Gold is one of the few precious metals names in positive territory this year after the GDX has reversed sharply to negative year-to-date returns.The outperformance can be attributed to its superior business model to producers with increased diversification and insulation from rising operating costs/capital costs that have weighed on producers.The company had a busy year where it invested the most since 2015 and its portfolio is better for it, with increased diversification and higher exposure to Tier-1 jurisdictions.However, while I see RGLD stock as a solid buy-the-dip candidate & one of the better ways to get gold/silver exposure, the ideal buy zone for the stock looks to be $100.00.
Torex Gold had an incredible year in 2022, generating ~$130 million in free cash flow despite elevated spend (Media Luna) and delivering within cost guidance and above output guidance.This was helped by solid cost controls, record underground tonnes mined and record mill throughput and despite considerable inflationary pressures that led to misses sector-wide.Unfortunately, while 2022 was a record year, 2023 and 2024 will be a little softer from an output/margin standpoint so the company will be lapping near insurmountable comps.While this isn't a huge deal if it were priced in, I don't see nearly enough margin of safety here and the stock remains a little extended, so I don't see any way to justify chasing the stock here at US$12.65.

SSR Mining released its Q4 & FY2022 results last month, reporting quarterly production of ~182,700 gold-equivalent ounces and annual production of ~623,800 gold-equivalent ounces [GEOs].While the strong Q4 was an improvement, SSRM saw a 21% decline in annual output with a significant decline in margins & the share price weakness isn't overly surprising.Unfortunately, FY2023 isn't expected to be much better, with a sharp increase in production but the potential for further AISC margin compression with elevated sustaining capital spend.Given the positive long-term outlook and SSR Mining's industry-leading shareholder returns, it remains a solid buy-the-dip candidate, but I see the more attractive buy zone being US$12.00 or lower.

Equinox Gold continues to be one of the worst-performing gold stocks, down 60% from its 2022 highs and nearly 80% from its 2020 highs.While this might seem like a major over-correction given that the gold price sits just $200/oz lower, we've seen severe margin compression, with AISC margins slipping from $758/oz to $162/oz.The good news is that Greenstone (60%) will come to the rescue in 2024, but Equinox won't see a meaningful benefit until 2025 once in commercial production.So, with another tough year ahead from a margin standpoint and uncertainty related to the ability to fund Greenstone without ATM usage, equity investment sales or non-core asset sales, I continue to see better opportunities elsewhere on a risk-adjusted basis.

Metalla continues to be one of the worst-performing precious metals stocks, declining 30% last year after already suffering a more than 40% decline in 2021.While this is certainly disappointing for shareholders, the underperformance was to be expected, given the 2021 overvaluation and the need for the excess to be wrung out of the stock.The good news is that Metalla is finally becoming more reasonably valued, and we've seen positive developments across its portfolio for key assets (Wasamac, Tocantinzinho, and others).That said, while I see Metalla as one of the better junior royalty and streaming companies, I don't see a low-risk buying opportunity just yet.

Osisko Gold Royalties is one of the best-performing royalty/streaming companies, up 11% year-to-date and flat in 2022 vs. a 3%/11% decline in the Gold Miners Index, respectively.I attribute the outperformance to disciplined growth and considerable exploration success across its portfolio, with it set up for several record years ahead.A key development is the AUY/AEM/PAAS deal that increases AEM's mill capacity in the region, making Osisko the premier way to get exposure to AEM's world-class portfolio with inflation protection.Given Osisko's industry-leading growth, capital discipline, and superior jurisdictional profile relative to peers, I see the stock as a Buy on dips.

Newcrest has been one of the best-performing gold producers since last summer, up ~25% since June vs. a negative performance for the Gold Miners Index.I attribute the outperformance to lapping easier comps than some of its peers and its unique benefit of copper by-product credits that have helped to keep costs below $1,200/oz.Unfortunately, fiscal Q2 2023 was a softer quarter due to a tragic fatality (Brucejack) and drought conditions (Lihir), but the stock was buoyed by a failed takeover offer by Newmont.While I see Newcrest as one of the better majors, I see limited upside for the stock following its material outperformance, and I would only get interested in the stock below US$13.10 from an investment standpoint.

Americas Gold and Silver was one of the worst-performing precious metals companies yet again last year, declining 29% despite shareholders having to endure a 75% decline in 2021.The company's guidance outlook suggests a much better year ahead, but the company continues to be a relatively small-scale producer, and costs will rise sharply as well.While the company is quick to point out the valuation discrepancy relative to peers, I continue to see USAS as cheap for a reason.With steady share dilution, one of the worst production growth per share trends in the sector, and an inability to deliver on promises, I see the stock as an Avoid at US$0.50.

Kinross released a maiden resource for its newly acquired Great Bear Project in Red Lake, as well as updated mineral resources/reserves last month.Unfortunately, the maiden resource at Great Bear came in well below my estimates and likely below most investors' expectations, reinforcing the view that it overpaid for GBR.Meanwhile, the level of reserve replacement was disappointing at existing assets as well, especially considering the 17% hike in the gold price assumption ($1,400/oz vs. $1,200/oz) to inform reserves.While KGC remains reasonably valued after 2 years of underperformance, I continue to see more attractive opportunities elsewhere, especially following the underwhelming Great Bear update.

Gold Fields is one of the worst-performing gold producers this year, down 11% year-to-date, which I attribute to a weaker 2023 outlook than some might have hoped for.Aside from group AISC that are expected to increase ~20% year-over-year (2023 vs. 2022), Salares Norte is behind schedule and won't pour gold until Q4 2023, representing a six-month delay.The good news is that 2024 should be a much better year with partial commercial production from its monster Tier-1 scale asset, Salares Norte, helping to claw back lost margins.However, with Gold Fields still not offering a meaningful margin of safety and up against tough comps because of last year's outperformance vs. peers, I see better opportunities elsewhere for now.
New Gold was one of the worst-performing gold miners last year for a second year running, down 34% for the year, which followed a 31% decline in the prior year.Unfortunately, 2023 hasn't been much better from a share-price performance standpoint, with the stock down 6% year-to-date, underperforming the GDX.The good news is that NGD has a better year ahead at both operations after a tough 2022, with output set to increase to 395,000 gold-equivalent ounces at the mid-point.At a share price of $0.90, NGD remains reasonably valued at less than 3.0x cash flow, but with costs well above the industry average and a volatile gold price, I continue to see much better bets elsewhere in the sector.

Argonaut Gold has gone from one of the best performing miners in Q4 2022 to one of the worst performers in Q1 2023 after a disappointing year-end report.The report saw another increase to upfront capex (3%), a significant miss on FY2022 cost guidance, an underwhelming 2023 outlook, and a large impairment.Although its current operating assets take a backseat to Magino, the weaker outlook will weigh on FY2023 cash flow, and I've had to revise fair value down given the outlook.At a current share price of US$0.33, Argonaut remains very reasonably valued, but I don't see the reward/risk ratio as favorable enough just yet, so I exited my position for a ~36% gain following the news.

Evolution Mining has declined over 25% from its highs and logged its fourth consecutive weekly decline, affected by weakening sentiment sector-wide with a sharp decline in the gold price.Unfortunately, the stock has underperformed the Gold Miners Index in the period, which I attribute to the stock being one of the most overbought names heading into February.However, Evolution had a solid fiscal Q2 report, H2 2023 is shaping up to be better, and it looks set to maintain its industry-leading margins with ongoing work at RL/Mungari.That said, while Evolution could easily put together an oversold bounce, I don't see the stock in a low-risk buy zone just yet, so I see patience as the best course of action for investors.
i-80 Gold has been one of the best-performing gold juniors since going public, with a 36% return over the past two years vs. a 35% decline in the GDXJ.This is entirely justified and the outperformance should be even more significant than it has been because i-80 Gold has made two major new discoveries in Nevada.Based on its recent discoveries, I see the potential for the company to produce 250,000+ gold-equivalent ounces per annum medium term and 400,000+ ounces long term, with further upside from GCOP/Mineral Point.A production profile of this size (400,000 ounces) at industry-leading costs in a Tier-1 mining jurisdiction (Nevada) can easily command a market cap of $2.50+ billion, so I see meaningful long-term upside to this story and see the stock as a steal below US$2.40.

Hecla released its Q4 and FY2022 results earlier this month, reporting annual production of ~14.2 million ounces of silver and ~175,800 ounces of gold.The solid Q4 performance helped cap off a solid year for the company and while it saw cost inflation that weighed on its margins, Hecla fared much better than its peers.I attribute this to Hecla operating low-volume, high-grade mines with by-product credits, though its relatively high-grade Casa Berardi Mine had a tough year and 2023 won't be any better.After a ~25% decline, Hecla is no longer overvalued and a short-term bounce is possible, but I don't see any margin of safety in place just yet, suggesting patience is the best course of action.
First Republic Bank's shares have been hammered on fears that the bank will see a run on its deposits push it into failure, as what happened at SVB and Signature.First Republic is in relatively better shape, including a higher ratio of tangible equity to unrealized losses and more diverse deposits and funding.Higher funding costs are almost certain and First Republic would do well to pull back on lending and rebuild a liquidity cushion, but that will impact earnings.I believe FRC is an earnings story more than a survival story, but the bank is not out of the woods if another wave of panic hits the market.
PacWest has come under severe pressure, as the market fears a run on deposits similar to SVB and an un-survivable squeeze on liquidity.Tech companies make up a significant percentage of PacWest's deposits, but the U.S. government has thus far backstopped both insured and uninsured depositors.Unrealized mark-to-market losses are a meaningful percentage of tangible common equity, but a new funding facility should eliminate the need to sell securities to raise funds.Management was already slowing loan growth and reprioritizing around its core community bank lending operations.I believe PacWest survives this liquidity squeeze, but there will still be consequences from lower loan growth, higher funding costs, and increasing credit losses.
Renesas exceeded sell-side expectations for Q4'22 earnings and Q1'23 guidance, sparking a major run in the share price.With auto MCUs still in short supply and Renesas leveraging business wins in areas like ADAS, the near-term outlook is healthy in auto.The near-term outlook in Industrial, Infrastructure, and IoT is less robust, but longer-term leverage to automation, electrification, IoT, and renewables remains attractive.Even after a big run, the shares look undervalued compared to many peers and rivals in the MCU space.
Hurco's fiscal first quarter results met my expectations, but did show clear weakness in North American and European sales that was significantly worse than typical industrial reports for the quarter.Uncertainty is the word of the day now, with many companies guiding to weaker demand in the second half of 2023 and warning of below-average visibility on customer demand.Hurco has been a "first in, first out" company in the past and results could be a sign of worse things to come for the broader group.I expect orders and revenue to turn around sooner here than for the larger group, and Hurco has good leverage to further growth in reshoring/near-shoring of manufacturing.Hurco shares offer a double-digit return from here, but this is an unfollowed, less-liquid manufacturing company that is far off most investors' radar.
SVB Financial triggered significant concerns about bank funding and liquidity when it announced multiple moves intended to improve asset sensitivity and raised capital on dilutive terms.Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo aren't immune to the impact of higher funding costs, but their liquidity situations are far different than SVB's positioning.SVB's news only adds to the concerns around the banking sector, but well-funded, well-capitalized banks like BAC, JPM, and WFC offer good long-term upside at these levels.

Roche has logged a few clinical successes lately, but hasn't scored the sort of big wins that change investment theses or drive lasting changes in sentiment.Fourth quarter pharmaceutical sales were fine, and Roche has a strong roster of $1B-plus/year drugs, but growth may be limited to around 3% to 4% over time.I expect mid-single-digit long-term FCF growth from Roche, and the company will continue to generate ample cash flow to fund R&D, M&A, and returns to shareholders.I continue to believe that Roche needs to fundamentally re-examine its approach to drug development, as pipeline productivity has been declining.Roche's underperformance leads to a more attractive valuation, but there is a real risk that the shares lag as a "value trap" without growth drivers that can excite the Street.
Caterpillar is a hotly-debated bellwether in the heavy machinery market, as bears believe most of the business is at or near the top of the cycle.Light construction does indeed look "toppy" to me, but I think underlying strength in heavy construction (infrastructure), mining, and oil/gas could prove stronger for longer.Caterpillar has traded at 20x to 25x trough EPS in the past.If a 20x to 25x P/E multiple is still valid, 20x the lowest EPS estimate on the board right now ($13.50 in FY'24) supports a fair value of $270.
Illinois Tool Works has continued to execute well on margins, but growth looks more limited given a lack of leverage to attractive long-term growth markets.Translating margin improvements into free cash flow hasn't been a consistent process, though I do expect progress toward 20% FCF margins over the next five years.Companies have gotten more cautious on auto volume predictions, and ITW has exposure to weakening construction and short-cycle industrial markets.Mid-single-digit FCF growth isn't enough to support an attractive return from here, and the shares already trade with a meaningful embedded quality premium.
Infineon's fiscal first quarter was a bit light on revenue, but better on margins, and guidance for the next quarter was strong relative to many chip companies.Auto demand looks healthy for 2023, as auto microcontrollers are sold out and demand for EV powertrain and ADAS chips is strong.Weakness in consumer markets is a known issue now, but emerging weakness in industrial markets (drives in particular) is something to watch.Infineon looks like a classic "short-term versus long-term" debate, with elevated risk in the short term from pricing, weaker orders, and so on, but a strong long-term outlook.Long-term revenue and FCF growth in the high-single-digit to low-double-digits can support a fair value roughly 20% higher than today's price.
Loma Negra's fourth quarter results should show still-healthy volumes, effective pricing actions, and EBITDA/ton in the low-$30s, but the weak macro environment in Argentina is going to weigh on 2023.Management has effectively leveraged improved volumes and pricing to drive better margins, as well as plant modernization and cost/logistics optimization.Further margin improvement is likely more dependent upon capex (plant modernization) and a better macro environment, including lower energy prices.The fate of Loma Negra's rail concession is still somewhat in doubt, particularly with respect to how efficiently the rail lines will operate after the concession ends.Loma Negra could be significantly undervalued if Argentina's economy improves, but that's a risky bet and it's tough for a good company to win out over a weak macro.
ING Groep's fourth quarter results were a little light on loan growth, but otherwise beat across the board, with a 25% pre-tax income beat driven by healthier spreads and provisions.I don't expect much loan demand growth from mortgage or corporate customers, so rate sensitivity will have to drive the bus from here; I expect double-digit NII growth in FY'23.Flush with capital, I expect another significant buyback announcement, but management may want to consider using some capital to acquire growing non-spread-dependent businesses (like payments).Core long-term growth of around 3%, including around 20% growth from FY'22-FY'25, can drive a fair value for the ADRs around $17.50, but a muted long-term growth outlook is a risk to sentiment.
ABB's fourth quarter results were mixed relative to expectations, with good revenue growth but some ongoing challenges in margins and free cash flow.Short-cycle exposure could hit ABB a little harder than some of its peers, particularly with a greater exposure to capex machinery versus subscription-based software.ABB offers good long-term exposure to automation and electrification, but there is work to do to optimize the portfolio, with an eye toward maximizing the revenue, margin, and FCF opportunities.A fair value in the mid-$30's doesn't offer abundant upside at today's price, and while the long-term growth opportunities are attractive, there are higher near-term macro risks.
Grupo Bimbo has been executing well across its operations, including improved product development, manufacturing, and distribution efficiency.Nielsen data suggests that customers are tapped out on prices, and increasingly shifting toward private label breads and sweet snacks to offset food cost inflation.There is scope for further market share gains and operational improvement, but Bimbo's valuation looks pretty fair today.
Ameris came up short on the topline in the fourth quarter, as a more fixed-rate loan book compared to many peers caps the near-term benefit of higher rates.Management has meaningfully diversified the loan book while also significantly upgrading the deposit base; modest asset sensitivity should be a positive from here, and I expect better-than-average deposit costs.Long-term core earnings growth around 6% can support a fair value around $50, while shorter-term multiples-based approaches support a $54 fair value.

AxoGen's revenue tracked a little ahead of expectations in FY'22, and the company has recently seen some momentum with surgeons increasing their usage of the company's grafts.Between the RECON results and a recent meta-analysis of past studies, the clinical argument for using AxoGen's products (good efficacy, patient outcomes, and costs) continues to strengthen.AxoGen shares look undervalued relative to what the market often pays for mid-teens revenue growth, but the company must step up account volumes and revenue growth to see a rerating.
Lexicon is getting closer to FDA approval for sotagliflozin, and the ongoing labeling discussions with the agency may prove critical in differentiating the drug from established rivals.Sotagliflozin may be superior in terms of reducing hospitalizations and cardiac events, but a lack of direct head-to-head studies could be an issue for more expansive labeling.Despite equivocal results in Phase II testing, management is planning a pivotal clinical trial program for LX9211 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.LX9211 does appear to produce pain relief, and with an attractive safety/risk profile, but it is unclear whether that relief will reach clinical significance in a well-designed pivotal study.I can argue for a fair value close to $6 on the basis of sotagliflozin and LX9211, but there are considerable challenges ahead.
Dana missed fourth quarter EBITDA expectations by a meaningful amount and lowered margin guidance as the company continues to see the impact of inflation and higher investments into EV capabilities.I continue to believe that Dana's investments into electrification are worthwhile, and the company boasts a growing backlog across light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and off-highway vehicles.It's going to take longer for Dana to get to my mid-single-digit FCF margin targets, but I still believe the shares are undervalued below the high teens.
HollySys posted good second quarter results, with the company continuing to grow its automation business in the petrochemical and oil/gas markets and rail projects getting back on track.The Chinese government is pushing for enterprises in strategic sectors to opt for local providers when possible, and that should benefit HollySys at the expense of international automation rivals.Expansion of the rail network, on catching up on pandemic-delayed projects, remains a government priority, but HollySys has to prove it can drive more consistent results here.HollySys is not overvalued assuming mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-to-mid-teens FCF margins, but investability is an issue as investor communication and disclosure are suboptimal.
Parker-Hannifin has continued to execute well, and the Street has become more confident in the company's long-term ability to generate above-market growth and margin leverage.Short-cycle markets still matter, though, and I expect to see weaker end-market demand as 2023 progresses.Parker-Hannifin offers an excellent track record and good growth, but the valuation largely reflects that.
First Horizon sparked a 10%-plus sell-off on news in its 10-K that Toronto-Dominion had informed them that they will not be able to complete the merger by the established deadline.Toronto-Dominion recently unveiled its $50B community investment plan, but it typically takes months after such plans to get approval, and further concessions may yet be required.Toronto-Dominion management sounded committed to the deal on its earnings call, and the deal is a meaningful one for the bank, but TD may push for some concessions.First Horizon has little bargaining power and would not be entitled to compensation if the deal collapses, and would in fact see dilution from preferred stock issued to TD.With a standalone fair value in the low-$20s, I think First Horizon investors will be OK if the deal collapses, but a negotiated extension is the better outcome.
Marvell once again lowered guidance, with broad weakness across much of the business, including the lucrative data center storage end-market.Growth drivers like 800G/1.6T PAM-4 and custom ASIC for artificial intelligence may need a bit longer to ramp, while accelerating 5G product sales will undermine margins.The Street convinced itself that Marvell was a differentiated growth story with less cyclical risk, and unwinding that is likely to lead to overcorrection in revenue and margin estimates.I like the long-term growth opportunities at Marvell, but I need to see more free cash flow conversion and the valuation isn't good enough for me yet.
Altra's fourth quarter results included a few curious items, as management's calculation of organic revenue may have understated underlying growth.The Automation and Specialty business appeared to have posted healthy double-digit growth on solid underlying automation demand, while Power Transmission Technologies looked a bit soft relative to peers/rivals.Results came in at the low end of management's earlier guidance, but margins still compare well to other industrial power/motion companies.Regal Rexnord is getting a high-quality business that should create meaningful synergies in attractive markets like automation and precision motion.There's really not enough upside left in Altra shares to be worth whatever risk there is that the deal doesn't go through.
FormFactor's fourth quarter results surpassed lowered expectations, but included a steep 25% year-over-year decline in wafer probe card revenue and major hits to the company's profitability.Technoprobe outperformed in FormFactor, but weaker guidance relative to FormFactor for Q1'23 leads me to wonder about the balance between market share and product/customer mix between them.I do still see risk that the cyclical semiconductor downturn could last a bit longer, but FormFactor should be leveraged to recovering logic markets in 2H'23.FormFactor's valuation is so-so now (a fair value in the low-to-mid-$30s), but rerating and beat-and-raise quarters later in 2023 are plausible.
Despite lower expectations, ams-OSRAM has continued to disappoint, including recent large cuts to guidance for Q1'23 and an early cut to 2024 guidance.The company's leverage to Apple (vs Android) smartphones has helped, but weaker Apple volumes are a risk in 2023, as is the company's skew to lower-value slots.Auto build rates should be positive in 2023, but the European market will likely be relatively weak and ams-OSRAM hasn't made the hoped-for progress in more advanced sensing-driven auto products.The microLED opportunity remains a significant one, and if ams-OSRAM can build an edge in assembly, it could establish valuable cost leadership.A new CEO could be the right medicine for this long-ailing company, and the expectations are low, but it will take time to rebuild the growth story.
BRF SA's fourth quarter results once again came in well short of Street profit expectations, but there was at least progress in the Brazilian operations.The Brazilian operations saw share gains in the processed food business and meaningful production/operating cost improvement.The international business is under pressure from weaker global poultry prices (oversupply) and a cost structure that is just too high to achieve sustainably attractive margins.Management seems to be on the right track with its improvement plans, and the share price is beaten down, but there are still significant operating and macro risks in play.
U.S. Bancorp's Q4'22 results were uninspiring on a core basis, but some of that was due to a meaningful balance sheet repositioning that should drive improved growth and capital returns.With the Union Bank deal done and the company beyond a pivot point after years of IT investment, this bank should deliver significant operating leverage over the next three years.Provided that the economy cooperates, I see a chance of high-teens' annualized pre-provision growth over the next three years.Many peer banks offer similar levels of potential return, but I like the operating leverage skew at U.S. Bancorp as it is more driven by execution than external factors.
Knight-Swift had a disappointing fourth quarter, as deterioration in the core trucking and logistics markets hit the company even harder than expected.Trucking continues to be pressured by overcapacity and weak freight demand, and an expected second-half recovery is tied to improved consumer spending and further retailer destocking.Management once again endorsed its $4/share-plus trough earnings target, but the Street is increasingly skeptical.I do like the long-term story at Knight-Swift, including diversification/expansion into less-than-truckload, but there are definitely risks to the near-term market outlook.
Heartland saw weaker operating earnings in the fourth quarter, with the business pressured by weaker freight demand, a weaker market for used equipment, and the inclusion of less-efficient acquired businesses.Trucking continues to correct, with spot rates down over 20% on weak freight demand and still-abundant capacity.Trucking demand should recover in the second half of 2023, but it may be too bullish to expect a big inventory-driven freight cycle.Heartland benefits from long-lasting relationships with large customers, but upside in 2023 will likely come more from cost synergies tied to the Smith and CFI deals.Heartland shares still look attractive below $18 as an early play on a trucking cycle recovery.
Hospital capital spending demand is strong, but Siemens Healthineers posted a small yet broad miss across its major business units for the fiscal first quarter.Imaging is performing well and Varian and Advanced Therapies were compromised by supply chain challenges, but core underperformance in Diagnostics is an ongoing issue.New launches in Imaging should drive attractive revenue growth, and Varian remains far and away the leader in radiation oncology, but Diagnostics needs more TLC.Siemens Healthineers shares look 15% to 25% undervalued today.
Eaton's fourth quarter results were largely in line with expectations, but included above-average revenue growth and good margin leverage.The Electrical business has a robust pipeline of business (backlog up nearly 100% in the Americas) on building retrofits, grid upgrades, and charging infrastructure growth.Eaton has excellent long-term leverage to automation, renewable power, and data traffic through its Electrical business, as well as leverage to aerospace and e-vehicle growth.The worst I can say about Eaton is that the valuation already factors in a lot of the good news, but the multi-year end-market outlook is among the best in the sector.
Weak PC shipments are a concern heading into Dell's fiscal Q4 report, but premiumization and lower component costs should help, but enterprise could be the bigger risk.Multiple sources are pointing to declining server and storage demand, threatening a weaker outlook for Dell over the next couple of quarters.Dell has leverage to edge cloud and AI spending on servers on storage, and opportunities in software, outsourcing, and IaaS, but has to prove it can achieve meaningful revenue growth.Dell looks undervalued on low single-digit growth assumptions, but low-growth tech value plays can take a long time to work.
ICU Medical spent far more time, energy, and resources than expected in 2022 on fixing Smiths Medical, but the heavy lifting seems largely done for most of the businesses.Allowing that current results don't reflect the full impact of the improvements management has made, underlying sequential performance in the core business was still lackluster in Q4.Results should continue to improve through 2023 as the 2022 fixes play out, but the "new normal" and real synergies aren't likely to emerge until 2024 and beyond.I can argue for a share price closer to $200, but the issues at Smith Medical have cost the company a year or so of leverage and improvement.
Core pawn operations were healthy in the fourth quarter, with double-digit growth in pawn receivables and mid-teens core pretax income growth.The lease-to-own operations are seeing steady credit trends, but weaker demand/volume and competition from a myriad of point-of-sale finance options could be playing a role.With access to stable and attractively-priced funding, FirstCash has an advantage over many fintech-based consumer finance rivals and should benefit through this more challenging phase of the cycle.Core long-term FCF growth in the high-single-digit, underpinned by steady results in the U.S. pawn business and ongoing expansion in Latin American pawn operations, can support a higher share price.
Honeywell's fourth quarter results were largely typical of the larger industrial sector and basically in-line with expectations, though with a modest segment-level earnings beat.Management guidance for FY'23 was perhaps more cautious than investors expected given its later-cycle leverage, but close to 40% of the business could arguably be called short-cycle.Aerospace should remain an area of strength, as should building automation, but warehouse automation, sensing, Productivity Solutions, and Advanced Materials could see some pressure in 2023.There will always be a lot of moving parts to the Honeywell story, but I expect 5% long-term revenue growth and 10% FCF growth, and the shares are back to a more reasonable valuation.
Lincoln Electric's fourth quarter results were very healthy in absolute terms but a little short of expectations and guidance for FY'23 had some notes of caution.General fabrication, heavy industry, and construction/infrastructure are markets to watch for possible weakness, while auto, energy, and longer-cycle mining and ag should be solid.Lincoln has steadily built up its capabilities in automation and new welding technologies and I expect even more leverage from these businesses in the coming years.Mid-single-digit core growth doesn't really support a substantially higher share price now and this is a name to jump on if there's a more significant pullback.
Alnylam's fourth quarter results were consistent with recently updated guidance, while guidance for FY'23 was modestly weaker for product revenue and more significantly weaker for collaboration revenue.The FDA will conduct an advisory panel meeting for the company's application for Onpattro in ATTR-CM, and I expect pointed questions/commentary about the endpoints and the breadth of the label.ALN-APP results are coming, and not only is Alzheimer's disease significant, this is an important milestone in extending Alnylam's addressable markets beyond liver-mediated diseases.A 15% or so pullback puts ALNY shares in a more favorable risk/reward position.
FEMSA's fourth quarter results were mixed, with healthy core traffic at OXXO, but some softness in retail margins and higher expenses for the digital businesses.Management completed their strategic review and announced a return to the company's core operations (retail, Coca-Cola FEMSA, and digital), with the Heineken stake and logistics/distribution operations to be sold.FEMSA's U.S. logistics/distribution operations were better than the Street gave credit for, but I believe refocusing on retail opportunities across the Americas is the better use of capital.FEMSA shares have done very well over the last six months or so but should still offer double-digit annualized return potential from here.
Bank of America has lagged since earnings, with above-average rate sensitivity seen as a risk if the Fed turns more dovish.Bank of America has improved its business on many fronts and it would take a sharp drop in the Fed Funds rate (around 250bp-300bp) to justify today's valuation.While Bank of America isn't my favorite large bank, it's hard to reconcile the current valuation with the quality and likely trajectory of the bank's earnings.
Curtiss-Wright announced modestly better fourth quarter results, with improved supply chain performance helping the Defense Electronics business.CW offers attractive leverage to recovering commercial aerospace markets, healthy defense markets, and improving nuclear power markets, as well as growth in areas like agricultural equipment.Long-term revenue growth around 6% and low double-digit FCF growth can support an okay return from here, but Curtiss-Wright could still rerate on its relatively better end-market exposures.
Brady produced fiscal second quarter results that included mid-single-digit revenue growth (which drove an EPS beat) and margin improvement.I believe leverage to healthcare, entertainment, and manufacturing is helping Brady outperform some of its peers while pruning inadequately profitable products is benefiting margins.Valuation looks more "okay" than "compelling", but Brady's self-help opportunities and market/product exposures could help drive a little outperformance as industrial output declines.
Interest rates have continued to wreak havoc on growth plays such as BSTZ.With the expectation that the Fed may have to go higher for longer, it can still put some uncertainty on this fund.Despite the risks, I continue to find BSTZ attractive at the current discount for a long-term investor.
TEAF invests in essential infrastructure projects, both public and private.The fund trades at a deep and attractive discount, presenting a potential investment opportunity.The fund sports an attractive 8.44% distribution yield but will largely rely on the underlying portfolio performing well.
Paramount Global is spending billions on new content, keeping FCF negative and EPS depressed.The spending is necessary to remain relevant and competitive for the long term rather than fade away.All this spending is to drive profitability in the future, but it means the dividend is rather precarious for now.I also share a recent covered call trade that expired worthless, though am cautious to not have shares called away.

Shares of AT&T have been on a downtrend and, despite improving, more recently sold off with the broader market.The communications sector, in particular, has been hard hit as competition is intense in the sector.T's dividend is well covered and debt is coming down, which can potentially provide a brighter future for the company.I highlight a recent covered call trade, and recap what we've been doing with shares of T.

CSQ invests mostly in equity holdings but carries a meaningful allocation to convertible and high-yield bonds.The market has been quite volatile, which is impacting this fund that will mostly follow around the broader market.The premium has also been pushed a bit higher to overinflate some of the returns beyond what the portfolio has provided.For those already holding CSQ, the premium hasn't pushed to a sell level yet, in my opinion.
PennantPark Floating Rate Capital had been on my watchlist for quite some time; I finally took a position recently.The business development company sold off after a share offering, right as the shares popped just a bit into premium territory.With higher interest rates and some more to go, BDCs can offer a place to put capital to work.
While interest rate hikes might be nearing an end, there are still some left to go that floating rate funds can benefit from.FRA continues to trade at an attractive discount, making it a potential option for investors to consider.They can bump up their distribution for shareholders even further after a large increase in 2022 due to the continued benefits of rising rates.
FIF has given investors 6 distribution increases in the last 6 months.Albeit, these are micro raises but trending in the right direction nonetheless.With a low distribution yield on the NAV, there is room for further increases.
The Nuveen Dow 30SM Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX) invests in the Dow Jones Average stocks and trades possible appreciation for higher current yield via their option strategy.This article will compare DJIA against what investors get by investing in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA); the same stocks but no option strategy.While providing a higher yield and more downside protection, DIAX is giving up 400bps in return consistently. There are better income-generating equity funds to own: Sell DIAX.

IBM's share price weakness belies its underlying strengths and forward potential.It's transitioning into growth areas including hybrid cloud and AI, a move that's been validated by tech peers.Long-term value and income investors may see potentially strong returns from the current discounted price and high yield.
Sixth Street Specialty Lending has an excellent track record of producing strong shareholder returns.It carries a reasonably strong balance sheet and pays a well-covered regular dividend supplemented by special dividends.The recent drop in price presents a solid opportunity for income investors to layer into this high yield.
UMH Properties is positioned to benefit from strong demand for manufactured housing.Inflationary pressures are a near term headwind, but could ease throughout this year, and it has new developments coming online.Recent drop in share price presents a good opportunity to pick up this income stock.
The Invesco S&P SmallCap 600 Pure Value ETF invests based on the S&P SmallCap 600® Pure Value Index.The Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF provides investors with an actively managed SCV ETF, versus RZV and other index-based choices.Both ETFs are reviewed and than compared. While AVUV has recorded the best return since starting in 2019, neither ETF has had back-to-back best results.

Medtronic is seeing a decent rebound to its topline, as the healthcare segment recovers.Management is transforming the company through cost reductions and investments in high growth and synergistic areas.The stock pays a decent dividend and appears to be value priced at present.
Alexandria Real Estate is hitting on all cylinders with near-record leasing activity and rent spreads.It has a strong line of sight with respect to tenant health and potential for future expansion.I also highlight the dividend, balance sheet, valuation, and other important points.
Veris Residential shares are up more than 50% over the past 5 months, mostly due to takeover speculation.Over the past 10 years, the company's shares have lost over 40%of their value.Veris is shedding its office and hotel properties and morphing into a pure apartment REIT.This article examines the growth, balance sheet, dividend, and valuation metrics for this intriguing small-cap REIT.
DHS, from WisdomTree, is a high-dividend ETF. It pays dividends monthly and is based on an index methodology that is somewhat unique among its peers.In this article, using DHS's summary prospectus, I briefly summarize this unique strategy and discuss some of its pros and cons.Next, I compare DHS against 2 competitors, both of which I hold in my personal portfolio, and reveal whether I plan to make any changes based on my findings.
Community Healthcare Trust depends on management's ability to discover off-market or lightly-marketed acquisition opportunities, leveraging the personal relationships between the management team and a wide array of medical providers.CEO Tim Wallace died last Friday, March 3. He had held that post since the company's inception, and his passing marks the end of an era at CHCT.The company reported mixed Q4 2022 results but maintains an exceptional balance sheet.Occupancy has stabilized in the low 90s, as management anticipated from the outset, and growth prospects remain strong.The loss of the most senior member of the management team provides a challenge for this company's business model.
DGRO holds a number of familiar dividend names that are leaders in their respective industries.It's slightly beaten the S&P 500 over the past 5 years, while giving more downside protection over the past year.It could be an ideal choice for those seeking an ETF that provides a combination of value and income.
The Pacer Trendpilot Fund of Funds ETF invests in other Pacer ETFs that invest based on selected indices based on market trends. The ETF is Globally invested.Each of the underlying ETFs are reviewed. A common review of how each index works is included. Where possible, the Trend ETF was measured against an equivalent non-trend ETF.While backtesting showed promise, in practice the results have not. With none of the held ETFs showing superior results except for lower StdDevs, I would pass on the whole set.
Williams Companies is a utility-like company with rate regulated gas pipelines and storage facilities.It's demonstrating record operating fundamentals and recent bolt-on acquisitions strengthen the company's future.With a strong balance sheet, high dividend coverage and yield, it appears that WMB stock offers excellent value at present.
T. Rowe Price is a well-recognized leader in the active asset management business.Its stock has underperformed major market indices this year and saw AUM growth in January.It has a strong dividend track record, is actively buying back shares at discounted levels, and is set up for potentially strong long-term returns.
PRF selects 1,000 large-cap U.S. companies based on four factors: dividends, free cash flow, sales, and book value. Fees are 0.39% and the ETF has $6 billion in assets.The portfolio is solid and well-diversified. However, there are cheaper alternatives with better long-term track records like the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF.Newcomers like OMFL and IUS are also exciting plays with superior short-term track records. In particular, IUS features an excellent balance of growth, value, and profitability.There aren't many significant flaws with PRF, though the lack of a leverage screen could explain recent underperformance. It's a nice factor ETF, but just isn't optimal, so I'm reiterating my hold rating.
MPLX has been rewarding investors with both robust unit repurchases and distribution increases.Its distribution is well-covered and it maintains a strong balance sheet with low leverage.Meanwhile, it trades at an attractive price while paying investors a high yield.
TDIV selects up to 100 U.S.-listed dividend-paying stocks in the Technology and Communications sectors. Its expense ratio is 0.50%, and it increased dividends by 8.46% over the last five years.The focus is dividend growth, not dividend yield. However, expected sales and earnings growth is just 6% over the next twelve months. High dividend growth is unsustainable.TDIV also has weak earnings momentum and poor Wall Street sentiment. With a 21.3x forward earnings valuation and a low 2% expected dividend yield, it's unappealing.I don't recommend TDIV stock but will compare its fundamentals alongside TDV, another dividend-focused fund worth exploring.
Verizon offers a compelling near-7% dividend yield that's well covered by earnings.It has opportunities to capitalize on its 5G investments towards the end of the year and on fixed wireless.The share price appears to be cheap enough for long-term income investors.
The Pacer Cash Cows Fund of Funds ETF invests by holding a mix of the five individual Cash Cow ETFs they manage.To understand HERD, each of those five ETFs is reviewed, with the main difference being the equity market they cover.A review of the Pacer Cash Cows Fund of Funds Index is reviewed, along with the individual indices used.Comparing HERD against the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, the Cash Cow approach has provided Alpha.
Kinder Morgan has mission-critical energy infrastructure and is seeing strong growth.It has ample excess cash flow after covering the dividend, with which it can invest in low carbon and carbon capture projects.It's attractively valued at present for income investors who seek high income to cover living expenses.
Ares Capital is producing excellent results with its largely floating rate portfolio.While there may be some uncertainty in the near term, this also isn't the management team's first go-around.Meanwhile, ARCC carries a strong balance sheet with plenty of liquidity and pays shareholders a well-covered dividend.
TC Energy is a strong Canadian midstream player with a long history of dividend growth.It's seeing strong demand for natural gas transport and should benefit from growing global demand for LNG.I also highlight the dividend, balance sheet, valuation, and other important points.

Comcast continues to trade at a well-below-average valuation.It has a valuable and moat-worthy collection of businesses and management plans to strengthen its broadband segment.Investors today could see potentially strong long-term total returns from present levels.
FCPI tracks the Fidelity Stocks For Inflation Index, selecting 100 U.S. equities based on valuations and positive momentum signals. Expenses are 0.29% and the ETF has $203 million in assets.FCPI outperformed SPY since my April 2022 review, but not by much. More focused, but more volatile, funds like EQRR proved superior.However, that's irrelevant because FCPI's portfolio turned over significant in the last year. My backtesting highlights how the current iteration doubled in value since December 2019.Considering Index reconstitutions is critical to proper fund analysis. Currently, FCPI trades at a 6.29-point forward earnings discount to SPY, is well-diversified, and less volatile than the market.Readers overweighting sectors like Energy likely have no need for ETFs like FCPI and EQRR. However, if you're seeking a dedicated inflation-protection solution, FCPI is a solid choice.
The Global X Hydrogen ETF was started in 2021 to invest based on the Solactive Global Hydrogen Index. Solactive is a German-based Index provider.As part of fighting climate change and going "green" in energy, there are those that believe hydrogen must play a major part in making the transition from fossil fuels possible.This article reviews the ETF and explores hydrogen's place in the future. So far, this ETF has not treated investors well. I'd classify it as a High-Risk; Possible High-Reward investment.
Kroger is a grocery giant with an efficient scale and has a leading share in its core markets.KR stock is demonstrating solid growth amidst economic uncertainty while offering consumers a compelling value proposition.I also highlight the dividend, balance sheet, valuation, and other important points.
Digital Realty recently capped off a strong year and has a robust backlog.It's set to benefit from continued client migration to the cloud and from the emergence of AI.The recent drop in price makes DLR an appealing choice for risk averse investors who also like high yield.
Spirit Realty is an attractive net lease REIT with a quality portfolio of mostly industrial and e-commerce resistant assets.It's seeing robust deal activity that mostly revolves around the growing industrial property segment.It pays an attractive and well-covered dividend yield while trading at a substantial discount to net lease peers.
FCOM holds 100+ Communication Services stocks in all size segments. It has a category-leading 0.08% expense ratio and $515M in assets.Performance compared to peers like XLC and VOX is solid, but the sector has historically underperformed the market. FCOM also comes with increased volatility and a poor growth profile.FCOM trades at 20x forward earnings, which is still too high. In addition, Alphabet controls 21% of the portfolio, and it has missed analyst estimates for four straight quarters.This article compares FCOM's fundamentals alongside five other Communication Services ETFs, and we think XTL is where investors should look for growth. Otherwise, avoid overweighting the sector altogether.
Viatris recently closed out 2022 having largely met management's prior guidance.It's aggressively paying down debt and recent acquisitions may drive meaningful growth down the road.It pays a healthy and well-covered starting yield, and share buybacks combined with a low valuation are highly accretive to shareholders.
The Bank of Nova Scotia's share price dropped significantly after releasing first quarter results.While it has near-term headwinds, the long-term growth thesis should be intact.With the dividend yield now comfortably above 6% again, long-term investors could see potentially strong returns from here.

The Avantis All Equity Markets ETF started last September and invests by holding 10 other Avantis ETFs.Besides sharing the allocation to each ETF held, a strategy description is provided for each of the ETFs held by AVGE.Comparing AVGE to the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, another Global Equity ETF, this new ETF is off to a good start. A comparison between those ETFs is provided.Approaching six months in existence, the AVGE is outperforming both the ACWI ETF and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF. There are allocation differences that the investor has to like.

Essex Property owns quality assets in high barrier to entry markets.It's seeing margin expansion and top and bottom line growth that outpaced inflation.Shares continue to trade weakly, offering income and value investors an excellent opportunity.
FNDX holds 700+ U.S. large-cap stocks weighted by leverage-adjusted sales, retained operating cash flow, and shareholder yield. Its expense ratio is 0.25% and the ETF has $10 billion in assets.I prefer forward-looking metrics, but FNDX trades at 17.79x forward earnings and is well-diversified across sectors and industries. Still, its 16.6% exposure to Technology stocks is too high.As a result, FNDX has poor earnings momentum and is at risk of a short-term correction. The sector's recent rally is unsupported by the latest  earnings reports and analyst revisions.This article compares FNDX's fundamentals against IWD, IWB, and IWF, three Russell 1000 Index ETFs tracking the value, blended, and growth segments. In my view, IWD looks superior.
3M is now trading at a very low valuation and pays a historically high dividend yield.The less-than-impressive guidance and litigation overhang appear to be more than baked into the share price.It's investing in high-growth areas, and patient value and income investors could see potential strong long-term returns.
Enbridge's utilization levels remain high, with records set in natural gas delivery and the Mainline liquids pipeline running at full capacity.It has an impressive slate of renewable projects including hydrogen and its recent acquisition of Tri Global Energy.ENB has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years, and the recent sell-off presents a great opportunity for income and value investors.

The Global X S&P 500 Risk Managed Income ETF invests based on the Cboe S&P 500 Risk Managed Income Index.The Global X NASDAQ 100 Risk Managed Income ETF invests based on the Nasdaq-100 Monthly Net Credit Collar 95-100 Index.Both ETFs and their respective indices are reviewed. Risks and returns are compared against similar option-writing ETFs.So far, I give both ETFs a Hold rating after doing those comparisons. Risk reduction working; returns lagging competitors.
