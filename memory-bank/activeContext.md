# Active Development Context

## Project Overview
Financial sentiment analysis system using Google's Gemma 3, Gamma 3 and FinBERT models with a modern web interface.

## Current Implementation Status

### 1. Machine Learning Pipeline
- âœ… NER processing with bert-base-ner to identify entity types
- âœ… Stock symbol detection and verification using yfinance
- âœ… Data labeling with Gemini API (7-class classification) focused on stock-specific tweets
- âœ… Gamma 3 model with LoRA fine-tuning and early stopping
- âœ… FinBERT model implementation
- âœ… Multi-metric evaluation system
- ðŸ”„ Gemma 3 model implementation with LoRA (in progress)

### 2. Web Application
- âœ… FastAPI backend with model serving
- âœ… Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- âœ… Real-time visualization components
- âœ… Docker development environment

### 3. Development Environment
- âœ… Docker Compose setup with Makefile commands
- âœ… Comprehensive environment variables in .env
- âœ… Development tools container for enhanced development
- âœ… Hot reloading for both frontend and backend

### 4. Sentiment Classes
1. STRONGLY_POSITIVE
2. POSITIVE
3. NEUTRAL
4. NEGATIVE
5. STRONGLY_NEGATIVE
6. NOT_RELATED
7. UNCERTAIN

### 5. Model Training Features
- LoRA configuration (r=8, alpha=16)
- Multi-metric early stopping
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Cohen's Kappa
  - Matthews Correlation Coefficient
  - ROC-AUC

### 6. Data Processing Enhancement
- Entity recognition using BERT-based NER model
- Stock symbol extraction and verification
- Focus on stock-specific sentiment analysis
- Filtering of non-stock-related financial tweets

### 7. Development Workflow
- Docker-centric development using `make` commands
- Container-based services with proper resource allocation
- Jupyter notebook integration via `make jupyter`
- Testing via `make test-backend` and `make test-frontend`

## Current Working Branches
- main: Primary development branch
- feature/model-training: Model training implementations
- feature/web-interface: Web application development

## Recent Updates
- Added stock symbol detection and verification step
- Added Named Entity Recognition (NER) preprocessing
- Modified data labeling to focus on stock-specific tweets
- Added Gemma 3 model implementation with LoRA fine-tuning
- Restructured development environment to be Docker-centric
- Replaced setup.sh with comprehensive Makefile
- Added development tools container
- Improved build system and cleanup procedures

## Next Steps
1. Train models specifically on stock-related tweets
2. Complete Gemma 3 model implementation and training
3. Implement model versioning system
4. Add model performance comparison visualization
5. Implement real-time sentiment analysis API
6. Add automated testing suite

## Technical Decisions
1. Using BERT-based NER to identify entities in financial tweets
2. Focusing ML training on tweets with verified stock symbols
3. Using LoRA for Gamma 3 and Gemma 3 to reduce training resources
4. Multi-metric early stopping for better model quality
5. Docker-based development for consistency
6. TypeScript + Tailwind for modern frontend
7. Makefile for standardized commands
