# Active Development Context

## Project Overview
Financial sentiment analysis system using Google's Gemma 3, Gamma 3 and FinBERT models with a modern web interface.

## Current Implementation Status

### 1. Machine Learning Pipeline
- âœ… NER processing with bert-base-ner to identify entity types
- âœ… Stock symbol detection and verification using yfinance
- âœ… Data labeling with OpenRouter's Gemini 2.5 Pro API (5-class classification) with Hugging Face's stock_market_tweets dataset
- âœ… Gamma 3 model with LoRA fine-tuning and early stopping
- âœ… FinBERT model implementation
- âœ… Multi-metric evaluation system
- ðŸ”„ Gemma 3 model implementation with LoRA (in progress)

### 2. Web Application
- âœ… FastAPI backend with model serving
- âœ… Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- âœ… Real-time visualization components
- âœ… Docker development environment

### 3. Development Environment
- âœ… Docker Compose setup with Makefile commands
- âœ… Comprehensive environment variables in .env
- âœ… Development tools container for enhanced development
- âœ… Hot reloading for both frontend and backend

### 4. Sentiment Classes
1. STRONGLY_POSITIVE
2. POSITIVE
3. NEUTRAL
4. NEGATIVE
5. STRONGLY_NEGATIVE

### 5. Model Training Features
- LoRA configuration (r=8, alpha=16)
- Multi-metric early stopping
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Cohen's Kappa
  - Matthews Correlation Coefficient
  - ROC-AUC

### 6. Data Processing Enhancement
- Entity recognition using BERT-based NER model
- Stock symbol extraction and verification
- Focus on stock-specific sentiment analysis
- Direct access to Hugging Face's stock_market_tweets dataset with Polars

### 7. Development Workflow
- Docker-centric development using `make` commands
- Container-based services with proper resource allocation
- Jupyter notebook integration via `make jupyter`
- Testing via `make test-backend` and `make test-frontend`

## Current Working Branches
- main: Primary development branch
- feature/model-training: Model training implementations
- feature/web-interface: Web application development

## Recent Updates
- Updated sentiment labeling to use 5 classes instead of 7 (removed NOT_RELATED and UNCERTAIN)
- Integrated OpenRouter for access to Gemini 2.5 Pro API
- Switched to using Hugging Face's stock_market_tweets dataset
- Implemented Polars for efficient dataframe operations
- Added parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor for better performance
- Restructured data labeling workflow to be more efficient and reliable
- Added stock symbol detection and verification step
- Added Named Entity Recognition (NER) preprocessing
- Modified data labeling to focus on stock-specific tweets
- Added Gemma 3 model implementation with LoRA fine-tuning
- Restructured development environment to be Docker-centric
- Replaced setup.sh with comprehensive Makefile
- Added development tools container
- Improved build system and cleanup procedures

## Next Steps
1. Train models using the new 5-class labeled data from stock_market_tweets dataset
2. Complete Gemma 3 model implementation and training
3. Implement model versioning system
4. Add model performance comparison visualization
5. Implement real-time sentiment analysis API
6. Add automated testing suite

## Technical Decisions
1. Using 5-class sentiment labeling for more focused sentiment analysis
2. Using OpenRouter for access to Gemini 2.5 Pro for better sentiment classification
3. Using Polars instead of Pandas for more efficient dataframe operations
4. Using BERT-based NER to identify entities in financial tweets
5. Focusing ML training on tweets with verified stock symbols
6. Using LoRA for Gamma 3 and Gemma 3 to reduce training resources
7. Multi-metric early stopping for better model quality
8. Docker-based development for consistency
9. TypeScript + Tailwind for modern frontend
10. Makefile for standardized commands
