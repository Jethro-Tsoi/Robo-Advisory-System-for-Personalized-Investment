# Active Development Context

## Project Overview
Financial sentiment analysis system using Google's Gamma 3 and FinBERT models with a modern web interface.

## Current Implementation Status

### 1. Machine Learning Pipeline
- ✅ Data labeling with Gemini API (7-class classification)
- ✅ Gamma 3 model with LoRA fine-tuning and early stopping
- ✅ FinBERT model implementation
- ✅ Multi-metric evaluation system

### 2. Web Application
- ✅ FastAPI backend with model serving
- ✅ Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- ✅ Real-time visualization components
- ✅ Docker development environment

### 3. Sentiment Classes
1. STRONGLY_POSITIVE
2. POSITIVE
3. NEUTRAL
4. NEGATIVE
5. STRONGLY_NEGATIVE
6. NOT_RELATED
7. UNCERTAIN

### 4. Model Training Features
- LoRA configuration (r=8, alpha=16)
- Multi-metric early stopping
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Cohen's Kappa
  - Matthews Correlation Coefficient
  - ROC-AUC

### 5. Development Environment
- Docker Compose setup
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- FastAPI backend
- Automated setup script

## Current Working Branches
- main: Primary development branch
- feature/model-training: Model training implementations
- feature/web-interface: Web application development

## Next Steps
1. Implement model versioning system
2. Add model performance comparison visualization
3. Implement real-time sentiment analysis API
4. Add automated testing suite

## Technical Decisions
1. Using LoRA for Gamma 3 to reduce training resources
2. Multi-metric early stopping for better model quality
3. Docker-based development for consistency
4. TypeScript + Tailwind for modern frontend
