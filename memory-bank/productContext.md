# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The financial markets are heavily influenced by KOL (Key Opinion Leader) sentiments, but existing sentiment analysis tools often fail to:
1. Accurately capture the nuanced opinions of influential market voices
2. Integrate sentiment data with traditional market indicators
3. Translate sentiment analysis into actionable trading strategies

## Solution Overview
PIRAS (Predictive Investment Research and Analysis System) bridges these gaps by:

### 1. High-Quality Sentiment Dataset

    KOL[KOL Content] --> DC[Data Collection]
    DC --> SL[Sentiment Labeling]
    SL --> QA[Quality Assurance]
    QA --> DS[Dataset]
```

- Focus on influential financial voices
- Rigorous labeling methodology
- Context-aware sentiment analysis
- Quality verification process

### 2. Integrated Market Analysis

    subgraph Processing
        S --> AI[AI Analysis]
        M --> AI
        F --> AI
    end
    
    subgraph Output
        AI --> TS[Trading Signals]
        AI --> RA[Risk Assessment]
        AI --> MA[Market Analysis]
    end
```
