# Technical Context

## Current Infrastructure

### Data Collection
- X API v2 (Twitter API) integration via tweepy with:
  - Smart rate limit tracking per endpoint (1 request per 15 minutes for free tier)
  - Monthly quota management (100 reads per month for free tier)
  - Batch processing with parallel execution
  - Dynamic quota management
  - Handling for 3,200 tweet per user limit
  - Intelligent distribution of quota across accounts
- Structured data storage in CSV format
- Enhanced logging system for monitoring and debugging

### Data Processing
- NER (Named Entity Recognition) pipeline using BERT
- Support for both CSV and Excel file formats
- Multi-format output capabilities (JSON, CSV, TXT)

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- Python: Primary development language
- tweepy: Twitter API client with rate limit handling
- crawlforai: Multi-source data collection
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- transformers: NLP tasks and model integration
- torch: Deep learning framework

- Git for version control
- Logging infrastructure for debugging
- Support for GPU acceleration when available

## Planned Enhancements
1. LLaMA Integration
   - Model fine-tuning pipeline
   - Sentiment analysis capabilities
   - Inference optimization

2. Economic Data Pipeline
   - API integrations for market data
   - Macroeconomic indicator processing
   - Data normalization tools

3. Trading Strategy Framework
   - Backtesting infrastructure
   - Risk management components
   - Performance analytics

## Technical Considerations
- Rate Limiting and API Quotas:
  - Per-endpoint quota tracking with reset windows
  - Monthly quota tracking for free tier (100 reads/month)
  - Dynamic response header analysis
  - Proactive rate limit management
  - Sequential request processing
  - Intelligent distribution of quota across accounts
- Platform Limitations:
  - X API v2 has a hard limit of 3,200 most recent tweets per user
  - Free tier limited to 100 reads per month and 1 request per 15 minutes
  - Premium API access required for historical data beyond this limit
- Resource Optimization:
  - Conservative batch sizes
  - Adaptive request pacing
  - Efficient error recovery
  - Strategic collection scheduling
- Data storage scalability
- Model deployment efficiency
- Real-time processing capabilities
